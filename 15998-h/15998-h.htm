<p class="tei tei-p">‚ÄîDARWIN TO WALLACE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">During the period covered by the reception, exposition,
and gradual acceptance of the theory of
Natural Selection, both Wallace and Darwin were
much occupied with closely allied scientific work.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The publication in 1859 of the "Origin of Species"<a name="noteref_1" id="noteref_1"></a><a href="#note_1"><span class="footnoteref">1</span></a>
marked a distinct period in the course of Darwin&#39;s scientific
labours; his previous publications had, in a measure, prepared
the way for this, and those which immediately followed
were branches growing out from the main line of
thought and argument contained in the "Origin," an
overflow of the "mass of facts" patiently gathered during
the preceding years. With Wallace, the end of the first
period of his literary work was completed by the publication
of his two large volumes on "The Geographical Distribution
<span class="tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span>
<a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of Animals," towards which all his previous
thought and writings had tended, and from which, again,
came other valuable works leading up to the publication
of "Darwinism" (1889).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It will be remembered that Darwin and Wallace, on
their respective returns to England, after many years
spent in journeyings by land and sea and in laborious research,
found the first few months fully occupied in going
over their large and varied collections, sorting and arranging
with scrupulous care the rare specimens they had taken,
and in discovering the right men to name and classify them
into correct groups.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At this point it will be useful to arrange Darwin&#39;s
writings under three heads, namely: (1) His zoological
and geological books, including "The Voyage of the
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Beagle</span>" (published in 1839), "Coral Reefs" (1842), and
"Geological Observations on South America" (1846). In
this year he also began his work on Barnacles, which
was published in 1854; and in addition to the steady
work on the "Origin of Species" from 1837 onwards,
his observations on "Earthworms," not published until
1881, formed a distinct phase of his study during the whole
of these years (1839-59). (2) As a natural sequence we
have "Variations of Animals and Plants under Domestication"
(1868), "The Descent of Man" (1871), and "The
Expression of the Emotions" (1872). (3) What may be
termed his botanical works, largely influenced by his
evolutionary ideas, which include "The Fertilisation of
Orchids" (1862), "Movements and Habits of Climbing
Plants" (1875), "Insectivorous Plants" (1876), "The
Different Forms of Flowers and Plants of the same
Species" (1877), and "The Power of Movement in
Plants" (1880).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A different order, equally characteristic, is discovered
<span class="tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span>
<a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in Wallace&#39;s writings, and it is to be noted that while
Darwin devoted himself entirely to scientific subjects,
Wallace diverged at intervals from natural science to
what may be termed the scientific consideration of social
conditions, in addition to his researches into spiritualistic
phenomena.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The many enticing interests arising out of the classifying
of his birds and insects led Wallace to the conclusion
that it would be best to postpone the writing of his book
on the Malay Archipelago until he could embody in it the
more generally important results derived from the detailed
study of certain portions of his collections. Thus it was
not until seven years later (1869) that this complete sketch
of his travels "from the point of view of the philosophic
naturalist" appeared.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Between 1862 and 1867 he wrote a number of articles
which were published in various journals and magazines,
and he read some important papers before the Linnean,
Entomological, and other learned Societies. These included
several on physical and zoological geography; six
on questions of anthropology; and five or six dealing with
special applications of Natural Selection. As these papers
"discussed matters of considerable interest and novelty,"
such a summary of them may be given as will serve to
indicate their value to natural science.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first of them, read before the Zoological Society in
January, 1863, gave some detailed information about his
collection of birds brought from Buru. In this he showed
that the island was originally one of the Moluccan group,
as every bird found there which was not widely distributed
was either identical with or closely allied to Moluccan
species, while none had special affinities with Celebes.
It was clear, then, that this island formed the most westerly
outlier of the Moluccan group.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span>
<a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next paper of importance, read before the same
Society in November (1863), was on the birds of the chain
of islands extending from Lombok to the great island of
Timor. This included a list of 186 species of birds, of
which twenty-nine were altogether new. A special feature
of the paper was that it enabled him to mark out precisely
the boundary line between the Indian and Australian
zoological regions, and to trace the derivation of the rather
peculiar fauna of these islands, partly from Australia and
partly from the Moluccas, but with a strong recent migration
of Javanese species due to the very narrow straits
separating most of the islands from each other. In "My
Life" some interesting tables are given to illustrate how
the two streams of immigration entered these islands, and
further that "as its geological structure shows ... Timor
is the older island and received immigrants from Australia
at a period when, probably, Lombok and Flores had not
come into existence or were unhabitable.... We can,"
he says, "feel confident that Timor has not been connected
with Australia, because it has none of the peculiar
Australian mammalia, and also because many of the commonest
and most widespread groups of Australian birds
are entirely wanting."<a name="noteref_2" id="noteref_2"></a><a href="#note_2"><span class="footnoteref">2</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Two other papers, dealing with parrots and pigeons
respectively (1864-5), were thought by Wallace himself to
be among the most important of his studies of geographical
distribution. Writing of them he says: "These
peculiarities of distribution and coloration in two such
very diverse groups of birds interested me greatly, and I
endeavoured to explain them in accordance with the laws
of Natural Selection."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In March, 1864, having begun to make a special study
of his collection of butterflies, he prepared a paper for the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span>
<a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Linnean Society on "The Malayan Papilionid√¶, as illustrating
the Theory of Natural Selection." The introductory
portion of this paper appeared in the first edition
of his volume entitled "Contributions to the Theory of
Natural Selection" (1870), but it was omitted in later
editions as being too technical for the general reader.
From certain remarks found here and there, both in "My
Life" and other works, butterflies would appear to have
had a special charm and attraction for Wallace. Their
varied and gorgeous colourings were a ceaseless delight
to his eye, and when describing them one feels the sense
of pleasure which this gave him, together with the recollection
of the far-off haunts in which he had first discovered
them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This series of papers on birds and insects, with others
on the physical geography of the Archipelago and its various
races of man, furnished all the necessary materials for the
general sketch of the natural history of these islands, and
the many problems arising therefrom, which made the
"Malay Archipelago" the most popular of his books. In
addition to his own personal knowledge, however, some
interesting comparisons are drawn between the accounts
given by early explorers and the impressions left on his
own mind by the same places and people. On the publication
of this work, in 1869, extensive and highly appreciative
reviews appeared in all the leading papers and journals,
and to-day it is still looked upon as one of the most trustworthy
and informative books of travel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When the "Malay Archipelago" was in progress, a
lengthy article on "Geological Climates and the Origin
of Species" (which formed the foundation for "Island
Life" twelve years later) appeared in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Quarterly
Review</span> (April, 1869). Several references in this to the
"Principles of Geology"‚ÄîSir Charles Lyell&#39;s great work‚Äîgave
<span class="tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span>
<a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
much satisfaction both to Lyell and to Darwin.
The underlying argument was a combination of the views
held by Sir Charles Lyell and Mr. Croll respectively in relation
to the glacial epoch, and the great effect of changed
distribution of sea and land, or of differences of altitude,
and how by combining the two a better explanation could
be arrived at than by accepting each theory on its own basis.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His next publication of importance was the volume entitled
"Contributions to the Theory of Natural Selection,"
consisting of ten essays (all of which had previously appeared
in various periodicals) arranged in the following order:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">1. On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of
New Species.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">2. On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely
from the Original Type.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">3. Mimicry, and other Protective Resemblances among
Animals.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">4. The Malayan Papilionid√¶.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">5. Instinct in Man and Animals.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">6. The Philosophy of Birds&#39; Nests.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">7. A Theory of Birds&#39; Nests.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">8. Creation by Law.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">9. The Development of Human Races under the Law of
Natural Selection.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">10. The Limits of Natural Selection as applied to Man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His reasons for publishing this work were, first, that
the first two papers of the series had gained him the reputation
of being an originator of the theory of Natural
Selection, and, secondly, that there were a few important
points relating to the origin of life and consciousness
and the mental and moral qualities of man and other
views on which he entirely differed from Darwin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Though in later years Wallace&#39;s convictions developed
considerably with regard to the spiritual aspect of man&#39;s
<span class="tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span>
<a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature, he never deviated from the ideas laid down in
these essays. Only a very brief outline must suffice to
convey some of the most important points.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the childhood of the human race, he believed, Natural
Selection would operate mainly on man&#39;s body, but in
later periods upon the mind. Hence it would happen
that the physical forms of the different races were early
fixed in a permanent manner. Sharper claws, stronger
muscles, swifter feet and tougher hides determine the survival
value of lower animals. With man, however, the
finer intellect, the readier adaptability to environment,
the greater susceptibility to improvement, and the elastic
capacity for co-ordination, were the qualities which determined
his career. Tribes which are weak in these qualities
give way and perish before tribes which are strong in them,
whatever advantages the former may possess in physical
structure. The finest savage has always succumbed before
the advance of civilisation. "The Red Indian goes down
before the white man, and the New Zealander vanishes in
presence of the English settler." Nature, careless in this
stage of evolution about the body, selects for survival those
varieties of mankind which excel in mental qualities. Hence
it has happened that the physical characteristics of the different
races, once fixed in very early prehistoric times, have
never greatly varied. They have passed out of the range
of Natural Selection because they have become comparatively
unimportant in the struggle for existence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After going into considerable detail of organic and
physical development, he says: "The inference I would
draw from this class of phenomena is, that a superior intelligence
has guided the development of man in a definite
direction, and for a special purpose, just as man guides the
development of many animal and vegetable forms." Thus
he foreshadows the conclusion, to be more fully developed
<span class="tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span>
<a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in "The World of Life" (1910), of an over-ruling God, of
the spiritual nature of man, and of the other world of
spiritual beings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">An essay that excited special attention was that on
Mimicry. The two on Birds&#39; Nests brought forth some
rather heated correspondence from amateur naturalists, to
which Wallace replied either by adducing confirmation of
the facts stated, or by thanking them for the information
they had given him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With reference to the paper on Mimicry, it is interesting
to note that the hypothesis therein adopted was
first suggested by H.W. Bates, Wallace&#39;s friend and
fellow-traveller in South America. The essay under this
title dealt with the subject in a most fascinating manner,
and was probably the first to arouse widespread interest
in this aspect of natural science.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next eight years saw the production of many important
and valuable works, amongst which the "Geographical
Distribution of Animals" (1876) occupies the
chief place. This work, though perhaps the least known
to the average reader, was considered by Wallace to be
the most important scientific work he ever attempted.
From references in letters written during his stay in the
Malay Archipelago, it is clear that the subject had a
strong attraction for him, and formed a special branch of
study and observation many years before he began to work
it out systematically in writing. His decision to write the
book was the outcome of a suggestion made to him by
Prof. A. Newton and Dr. Sclater about 1872. In addition
to having already expressed his general views on this subject
in various papers and articles, he had, after careful
consideration, come to adopt Dr. Sclater&#39;s division of the
earth&#39;s surface into six great zoological regions, which he
found equally applicable to birds, mammalia, reptiles, and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span>
<a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other great divisions; while at the same time it helped to
explain the apparent contradictions in the distribution of
land animals. Some years later he wrote:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In whatever work I have done I have always aimed
at systematic arrangement and uniformity of treatment
throughout. But here the immense extent of the subject,
the overwhelming mass of detail, and above all the excessive
diversities in the amount of knowledge of the different
classes of animals, rendered it quite impossible to treat all
alike. My preliminary studies had already satisfied me that
it was quite useless to attempt to found any conclusions on
those groups which were comparatively little known, either
as regards the proportion of species collected and described,
or as regards their systematic classification. It was also
clear that as the present distribution of animals is necessarily
due to their past distribution, the greatest importance
must be given to those groups whose fossil remains
in the more recent strata are the most abundant and the
best known. These considerations led me to limit my work
in its detailed systematic groundwork, and study of the
principles and law of distribution, to the mammalia and
birds, and to apply the principles thus arrived at to an
explanation of the distribution of other groups, such as
reptiles, fresh-water fishes, land and fresh-water shells,
and the best-known insect Orders.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There remained another fundamental point to consider.
Geographical distribution in its practical applications and
interest, both to students and to the general reader, consists
of two distinct divisions, or rather, perhaps, may be looked
at from two points of view. In the first of these we divide
the earth into regions and sub-regions, study the causes
which have led to the difference in their animal productions,
give a general account of these, with the amount of
resemblance to and difference from other regions; and we
may also give lists of the families and genera inhabiting
each, with indications as to which are peculiar and which
are also found in adjacent regions. This aspect of the
study I term zoological geography, and it is that which
<span class="tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span>
<a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would be of most interest to the resident or travelling
naturalist, as it would give him, in the most direct and
compact form, an indication of the numbers and kinds of
animals he might expect to meet with.<a name="noteref_3" id="noteref_3"></a><a href="#note_3"><span class="footnoteref">3</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The keynote of the general scheme of distribution, as
set forth in these two volumes, may be expressed as an
endeavour to compare the extinct and existing fauna of
each country and to trace the course by which what is
now peculiar to each region had come to assume its
present character. The main result being that all the
higher forms of life seem to have originally appeared in
the northern hemisphere, which has sent out migration
after migration to colonise the three southern continents;
and although varying considerably from time to time in
form and extent, each has kept essentially distinct, while
at the same time receiving periodically wave after wave
of fresh animal life from the northward.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This again was due to many physical causes such
as peninsulas parting from continents as islands, islands
joining and making new continents, continents breaking
up or effecting junction with or being isolated from one
another. Thus Australia received the germ of her present
abundant fauna of pouched mammals when she was part
of the Old-World continent, but separated from that too
soon to receive the various placental mammals which have,
except in her isolated area, superseded those older forms.
So, also, South America, at one time unconnected with
North America, developed her great sloths and armadilloes,
and, on fusing with the latter, sent her megatheriums
to the north, and received mastodons and large cats in
exchange.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Some of the points, such for instance as the division
of the sub-regions into which each greater division is
<span class="tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span>
<a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
separated, gave rise to considerable controversy. Wallace&#39;s
final estimate of the work stands: "No one is more
aware than myself of the defects of the work, a considerable
portion of which are due to the fact that it was written
a quarter of a century too soon‚Äîat a time when both
zoological and pal√¶ontological discovery were advancing
with great rapidity, while new and improved classifications
of some of the great classes and orders were in constant
progress. But though many of the details given in
these volumes would now require alteration, there is no
reason to believe that the great features of the work and
general principles established by it will require any important
modification."<a name="noteref_4" id="noteref_4"></a><a href="#note_4"><span class="footnoteref">4</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">About this time he wrote the article on "Acclimatisation"
for the "Encyclop√¶dia Britannica"; and another
on "Distribution-Zoology" for the same work. As President
of the Biological Section of the British Association
he prepared an address for the meeting at Glasgow; wrote
a number of articles and reviews, as well as his remarkable
book on "Miracles and Modern Spiritualism." In
1878 he published "Tropical Nature," in which he gave
a general sketch of the climate, vegetation, and animal life
of the equatorial zone of the tropics from his own observations
in both hemispheres. The chief novelty was, according
to his own opinion, in the chapter on "climate," in
which he endeavoured to show the exact causes which
produce the difference between the uniform climate of the
equatorial zone, and that of June and July in England.
Although at that time <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">we</span> receive actually more of the light
and heat of the sun than does Java or Trinidad in December,
yet these places have then a mean temperature very
much higher than ours. It contained also a chapter on
humming-birds, as illustrating the luxuriance of tropical
<span class="tei-pb" id="page012">[pg 012]</span>
<a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
nature; and others on the colours of animals and of
plants, and on various biological problems.<a name="noteref_5" id="noteref_5"></a><a href="#note_5"><span class="footnoteref">5</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Island Life"<a name="noteref_6" id="noteref_6"></a><a href="#note_6"><span class="footnoteref">6</span></a> (published 1880) was begun in 1877, and
occupied the greater part of the next three years. This
had been suggested by certain necessary limitations in the
writing of "The Geographical Distribution of Animals."
It is a fascinating account of the relations of islands to
continents, of their unwritten records of the distribution
of plant and animal life in the morning time of the earth,
of the causes and results of the glacial period, and of the
manner of reckoning the age of the world from geological
data. It also included several new features of natural
science, and still retains an important place in scientific
literature. No better summary can be given than that by
the author himself:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In my "Geographical Distribution of Animals" I had,
in the first place, dealt with the larger groups, coming
down to families and genera, but taking no account of the
various problems raised by the distribution of particular
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">species</span>. In the next place, I had taken little account of
the various islands of the globe, excepting as forming sub-regions
or parts of sub-regions. But I had long seen the
great interest and importance of these, and especially of
Darwin&#39;s great discovery of the two classes into which they
are naturally divided‚Äîoceanic and continental islands. I
had already given lectures on this subject, and had become
aware of the great interest attaching to them, and the great
light they threw upon the means of dispersal of animals and
plants, as well as upon the past changes, both physical and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span>
<a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
means of dispersal and colonisation of animals is so connected
with, and often dependent on, that of plants, that
a consideration of the latter is essential to any broad views
as to the distribution of life upon the earth, while they
throw unexpected light upon those exceptional means of
dispersal which, because they are exceptional, are often
of paramount importance in leading to the production of
new species and in thus determining the nature of insular
floras and faunas.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Having no knowledge of scientific botany, it needed some
courage, or, as some may think, presumption, to deal with
this aspect of the problem; but ... I had long been excessively
fond of plants, and ... interested in their distribution.
The subject, too, was easier to deal with, on account
of the much more complete knowledge of the detailed distribution
of plants than of animals, and also because their
classification was in a more advanced and stable condition.
Again, some of the most interesting islands of the globe had
been carefully studied botanically by such eminent botanists
as Sir Joseph Hooker for the Galapagos, New Zealand, Tasmania,
and the Antarctic islands; Mr. H.C. Watson for the
Azores; Mr. J.G. Baker for Mauritius and other Mascarene
islands; while there were floras by competent botanists of the
Sandwich Islands, Bermuda and St. Helena....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But I also found it necessary to deal with a totally
distinct branch of science‚Äîrecent changes of climate as
dependent on changes of the earth&#39;s surface, including the
causes and effects of the glacial epoch, since these were
among the most powerful agents in causing the dispersal
of all kinds of organisms, and thus bringing about the
actual distribution that now prevails. This led me to a
careful study of Mr. James Croll&#39;s remarkable works on
the subject of the astronomical causes of the glacial and
interglacial periods.... While differing on certain
details, I adopted the main features of his theory, combining
with it the effects of changes in height and extent
of land which form an important adjunct to the meteorological
agents....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Besides this partially new theory of the causes of glacial
<span class="tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span>
<a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
epochs, the work contained a fuller statement of the various
kinds of evidence proving that the great oceanic basins are
permanent features of the earth&#39;s surface, than had before
been given; also a discussion of the mode of estimating the
duration of geological periods, and some considerations leading
to the conclusion that organic change is now less rapid
than the average, and therefore that less time is required
for this change than has hitherto been thought necessary. I
was also, I believe, the first to point out the great difference
between the more ancient continental islands and those of
more recent origin, with the interesting conclusions as to
geographical changes afforded by both; while the most
important novelty is the theory by which I explained the
occurrence of northern groups of plants in all parts of
the southern hemisphere‚Äîa phenomenon which Sir Joseph
Hooker had pointed out, but had then no means of explaining.<a name="noteref_7" id="noteref_7"></a><a href="#note_7"><span class="footnoteref">7</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1878 Wallace wrote a volume on Australasia for Stanford&#39;s
"Compendium of Geography and Travel." A later
edition was published in 1893, which contained in addition
to the physical geography, natural history, and geology of
Australia, a much fuller account of the natives of Australia,
showing that they are really a primitive type of the great
Caucasian family of mankind, and are by no means so low
in intellect as had been usually believed. This view has since
been widely accepted.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Having, towards the close of 1885, received an invitation
from the Lowell Institute, Boston, U.S.A., to deliver
a course of lectures in the autumn and winter of 1886,
Wallace decided upon a series which would embody those
theories of evolution with which he was most familiar,
with a special one on "The Darwinian Theory" illustrated
by a set of original diagrams on variation. These
lectures eventually became merged into the well-known
book entitled "Darwinism."
<span class="tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span>
<a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On the first delivery of his lecture on the "Darwinian
Theory" at Boston it was no small pleasure to Wallace
to find the audience both large and attentive. One of the
newspapers expressed the public appreciation in the following
truly American fashion: "The first Darwinian,
Wallace, did not leave a leg for anti-Darwinism to stand
on when he had got through his first Lowell Lecture last
evening. It was a masterpiece of condensed statement‚Äîas
clear and simple as compact‚Äîa most beautiful specimen
of scientific work. Dr. Wallace, though not an orator, is
likely to become a favourite as a lecturer, his manner is
so genuinely modest and straightforward."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wherever he went during his tour of the States this
lecture more than all others attracted and pleased his
audiences. Many who had the opportunity of conversing
with him, and others by correspondence, confessed that
they had not been able to understand the "Origin of
Species" until they heard the facts explained in such a
lucid manner by him. It was this fact, therefore, which
led him, on his return home in the autumn of 1887, to
begin the preparation of the book ("Darwinism") published
in 1889. The method he chose was that of following
as closely as possible the lines of thought running
through the "Origin of Species," to which he added many
new features, in addition to laying special emphasis on the
parts which had been most generally misunderstood.
Indeed, so fairly and impartially did he set forth the
general principles of the Darwinian theory that he was
able to say: "Some of my critics declare that I am
more Darwinian than Darwin himself, and in this, I
admit, they are not far wrong."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His one object, as set out in the Preface, was to treat
the problem of the origin of species from the standpoint
reached after nearly thirty years of discussion, with an
<span class="tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span>
<a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abundance of new facts and the advocacy of many new
and old theories. As it had frequently been considered a
weakness on Darwin&#39;s part that he based his evidence
primarily on experiments with domesticated animals and
cultivated plants, Wallace desired to secure a firm foundation
for the theory in the variation of organisms in a state
of nature. It was in order to make these facts intelligible
that he introduced a number of diagrams, just as Darwin
was accustomed to appeal to the facts of variation among
dogs and pigeons.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Another change which he considered important was that
of taking the struggle for existence first, because this is
the fundamental phenomenon on which Natural Selection
depends. This, too, had a further advantage in that, after
discussing variations and the effects of artificial selection,
it was possible at once to explain how Natural Selection acts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The subjects treated with novelty and interest in their
important bearings on the theory of Natural Selection
were: (1) A proof that all <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">specific</span> characters are (or once
have been) either useful in themselves or correlated with
useful characters (Chap. VI.); (2) a proof that Natural
Selection can, in certain cases, increase the sterility of
crosses (Chap. VII.); (3) a fuller discussion of the colour
relations of animals, with additional facts and arguments
on the origin of sexual differences of colour (Chaps. VIII.-X.);
(4) an attempted solution of the difficulty presented
by the occurrence of both very simple and complex modes
of securing the cross-fertilisation of plants (Chap. XI.);
(5) some fresh facts and arguments on the wind-carriage
of seeds, and its bearing on the wide dispersal of many
arctic and alpine plants (Chap. XII.); (6) some new illustrations
of the non-heredity of acquired characters, and a
proof that the effects of use and disuse, even if inherited,
must be overpowered by Natural Selection (Chap. XIV.);
<span class="tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span>
<a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and (7) a new argument as to the nature and origin of the
moral and intellectual faculties of man (Chap. XV.).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Although I maintain, and even enforce," wrote Wallace,
"my differences from some of Darwin&#39;s views, my
whole work tends forcibly to illustrate the overwhelming
importance of Natural Selection over all other agencies in
the production of new species. I thus take up Darwin&#39;s
earlier position, from which he somewhat receded in the
later editions of his works, on account of criticisms and
objections which I have endeavoured to show are unsound.
Even in rejecting that phase of sexual selection depending
on female choice, I insist on the greater efficacy of Natural
Selection. This is pre-eminently the Darwinian doctrine,
and I therefore claim for my book the position of being the
advocate of pure Darwinism."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In concluding this section which, like a previous one,
touches upon the intimate relations between Darwin and
Wallace, and the points on which they agreed or differed,
it is well, as the differences have been exaggerated and misunderstood,
to bear in mind his own declaration: "None
of my differences from Darwin imply any real divergence
as to the overwhelming importance of the great principle
of natural selection, while in several directions I believe
that I have extended and strengthened it."<a name="noteref_8" id="noteref_8"></a><a href="#note_8"><span class="footnoteref">8</span></a></p>

the other day, I had not read it. I have since done
so with great interest. Its leading idea is, I think, undoubtedly
true, and of much importance towards an interpretation

purely physical modifications that may be shown to result
from the direct influence of civilisation, yet I think it is

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Sir,‚ÄîI have been reading with great interest
your paper on the Origin of the Races of Man, in which I

with such admirable clearness and fairness that that alone

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">73 Harley Street. March 19, 1867.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Wallace,‚ÄîI am citing your two papers in my
second volume of the new edition of the "Principles"‚Äîthat
on the Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago,
1863, and the other on Varieties of Man in ditto, 1864. I
am somewhat confounded with the marked line which you
draw between the two provinces on each side of the Straits
of Lombok. It seems to me that Darwin and Hooker have
scarcely given sufficient weight to the objection which it
affords to some of their arguments. First, in regard to
continental extension, if these straits could form such a
barrier, it would seem as if nothing short of a land communication
could do much towards fusing together two
distinct faunas and floras. But here comes the question‚Äîare
there any land-quadrupeds in Bali or in Lombok?
I think you told me little was known of the plants, but
perhaps you know something of the insects. It is impossible
that birds of long flight crossing over should not
have conveyed the seeds and eggs of some plants, insects,
mollusca, etc. Then the currents would not be idle, and
during such an eruption as that of Tomboro in Sumbawa
all sorts of disturbances, aerial, aquatic and terrestrial,
would have scattered animals and plants.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When I first wrote, thirty-five years ago, I attached
great importance to preoccupancy, and fancied that a
body of indigenous plants already fitted for every available
<span class="tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span>
<a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
station would prevent an invader, especially from, a
quite foreign province, from having a chance of making
good his settlement in a new country. But Darwin and
Hooker contend that continental species which have been
improved by a keen and wide competition are most
frequently victorious over an insular or more limited flora
and fauna. Looking, therefore, upon Bali as an outpost
of the great Old World fauna, it ought to beat Lombok,
which only represents a less rich and extensive fauna,
namely the Australian.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You may perhaps answer that Lombok is an outpost
of an army that may once have been as multitudinous as
that of the old continent, but the larger part of the host
have been swamped in the Pacific. But they say that
European forms of animals and plants run wild in Australia
and New Zealand, whereas few of the latter can do
the same in Europe. In my map there is a small island
called Nousabali; this ought to make the means of migration
of seeds and animals less difficult. I cannot find that
you say anywhere what is the depth of the sea between the
Straits of Lombok, but you mention that it exceeds 100
fathoms. I am quite willing to infer that there is a connection
between these soundings and the line of demarcation
between the two zoological provinces, but must we
suppose land communication for all birds of short flight?
Must we unite South America with the Galapagos Islands?
Can you refer me to any papers by yourself which might
enlighten me and perhaps answer some of these queries?
I should have thought that the intercourse even of savage
tribes for tens of thousands of years between neighbouring
islands would have helped to convey in canoes many animals
and plants from one province to another so as to help to
confound them. Your hypothesis of the gradual advance
of two widely separated continents towards each other
<span class="tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span>
<a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seems to be the best that can be offered. You say that a
rise of a hundred fathoms would unite the Philippine
Islands and Bali to the Indian region. Is there, then, a
depth of 600 feet in that narrow strait of Bali, which seems
in my map only two miles or so in breadth?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I have [been] confined to the house for a week by a cold
or I should have tried to see you. I am afraid to go out
to-day.‚ÄîBelieve me ever most truly yours,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">73 Harley Street. April 4, 1867.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Wallace,‚ÄîI have been reading over again your
paper published in 1855 in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Annals</span> on "The Law which
has regulated the Introduction of New Species"; passages
of which I intend to quote, not in reference to your priority
of publication, but simply because there are some points
laid down more clearly than I can find in the work of
Darwin itself, in regard to the bearing of the geological
and zoological evidence on geographical distribution and the
origin of species. I have been looking into Darwin&#39;s historical
sketch thinking to find some allusion to your essay
at page xx., 4th ed., when he gets to 1855, but I can find
no allusion to it. Yet surely I remember somewhere a
passage in which Darwin says in print that you had told
him that in 1855 you meant by such expressions as "species
being created on the type of pre-existing ones closely allied,"
and by what you say of modified prototypes, and by the passage
in which you ask "what rudimentary organs mean if
each species has been created independently," etc., that new
species were created by variation and in the way of ordinary
generation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Your last letter was a great help to me, for it was a
relief to find that the Lombok barrier was not so complete
<span class="tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span>
<a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as to be a source of difficulty. I have also to thank you for
your papers, one of which I had read before in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Natural
History Review</span>, but I am very glad of a separate copy. I
am rather perplexed by Darwin speculating on the possibility
of New Zealand having once been united with Australia
(p. 446, 4th Ed.). The puzzle is greater than I can
get over, even looking upon it as an oceanic island. Why
should there have been no mammalia, rodents and marsupials,
or only one mouse? Even if the Glacial period was
such that it was enveloped in a Greenlandic winding-sheet,
there would have been some Antarctic animals? It cannot
be modern, seeing the height of those alps. It may have
been a set of separate smaller islands, an archipelago since
united into fewer. No savages could have extirpated
mammalia, besides we should have found them fossil in
the same places with all those species of extinct Dinornis
which have come to light. Perhaps you will say that the
absence of mammalia in New Caledonia is a corresponding
fact.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This reminds me of another difficulty. On the hypothesis
of the coral islands being the last remnants of a
submerged continent, ought they not to have in them a
crowd of peculiar and endemic types, each rivalling St.
Helena, instead of which I believe they are very poor [in]
peculiar genera. Have they all got submerged for a short
time during the ups and downs to which they have been
subjected, Tahiti and some others having been built up by
volcanic action in the Pliocene period? Madeira and the
Canaries were islands in the Upper Miocene ocean, and
may therefore well have peculiar endemic types of very
old date, and destroyed elsewhere. I have just got in
Wollaston&#39;s "Coleoptera Atlantidum," and shall be glad to
lend it you when I have read the Introduction. He goes
in for continental extension, which only costs him two

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Sir,‚ÄîI forgot to ask you last night about an
ornithological point which I have been discussing with the
Duke of Argyll. In Chapter V. of his "Reign of Law"
(which I should be happy to lend you, if you have time to
look at it immediately) he treats of humming-birds, saying
that Gould has made out about 400 species, every one of
them very distinct from the other, and only one instance,
in Ecuad√≥r, of a species which varies in its tail-feathers in
such a way as to make it doubtful whether it ought to rank
as a species, an opinion to which Gould inclines, or only as
a variety or incipient species, as the Duke thinks. For the
Duke is willing to go so far towards the transmutation
theory as to allow that different humming-birds may have
had a common ancestral stock, provided it be admitted that
a new and marked variety appears at once with the full
distinctness of sex so remarkable in that genus.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">According to his notion, the new male variety and the
female must both appear at once, and this new race or
species must be regarded as an "extraordinary birth." My
reason for troubling you is merely to learn, since you have
studied the birds of South America, and I hope collected
some humming-birds, whether Gould is right in saying that
there are so many hundred very distinct species without
instances of marked varieties and transitional forms. If this
be the case, would it not present us with an exception to the
rule laid down by Darwin and Hooker that when a genus is
largely represented in a continuous tract of land the species
of that genus tend to vary?
<span class="tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span>
<a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I have inquired of Sclater and he tells me that he has a
considerable distrust of Gould&#39;s information on this point,
but that he has not himself studied humming-birds.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In regard to shells, I have always found that dealers have
a positive prejudice against intermediate forms, and one of
the most philosophical of them, now no more, once confessed
to me that it was very much against his trade interest to
give an honest opinion that certain varieties were not real
species, or that certain forms, made distinct genera by some
conchologists, ought not so to rank. Nine-tenths of his customers,
if told that it was not a good genus or good species,
would say, "Then I need not buy it." What they wanted
was names, not things. Of course there are genera in which
the species are much better defined than in others, but you
would explain this, as Darwin and Hooker do, by the greater
length of time during which they have existed, or the greater
activity of changes, organic and inorganic, which have taken
place in the region inhabited by the generic or family type
in question. The manufactory of new species has ceased,
or nearly so, and in that case I suppose a variety is more
likely to be one of the transitional links which has not yet
been extinguished than the first step towards a new permanent
race or allied species....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Your last letter will be of great use to me. I had cited
the case of beetles recovering from immersion of hours in
alcohol from my own experience, but am glad it strikes you
in the same light. McAndrew told me last night that the
littoral shells of the Azores being European, or rather
African, is in favour of a former continental extension, but
I suspect that the floating of seaweed containing their eggs
may dispense with the hypothesis of the submersion of 1,200
miles of land once intervening. I want naturalists carefully
to examine floating seaweed and pumice met with at sea.

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Spencer,‚ÄîAfter leaving you yesterday I
thought a little over your objections to the Duke of Argyll&#39;s
theory of flight on the ground that it does not apply to
insects, and it seems to me that exactly the same general
principles do apply to insects as to birds. I read over the
Duke&#39;s book without paying special attention to that part
of it, but as far as I remember, the case of insects offers no
difficulty in the way of applying his principles. If any wing
were a rigid plane surface, it appears to me that there are
only two ways in which it could be made to produce flight.
Firstly, on the principle that the resistance in a fluid, and I
believe also in air, increases in a greater ratio than the
velocity (? as the square), the descending stroke might be
more rapid than the ascending one, and the resultant would
be an upward or forward motion. Secondly, some kind of
furling or feathering by a rotatory motion of the wing might
take place on raising the wings. I think, however, it is clear
that neither of these actions occurs during the flight of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span>
<a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
insects. In both slow- and quick-flying species there is no
appearance of such a difference of velocity, and I am not
aware that anyone has attempted to prove that it occurs;
and the fact that in so many insects the edges of the fore and
hind wings are connected together, while their insertions at
the base are at some distance apart, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">entirely precludes a rotation
of the wings</span>. The whole structure and form of the
wings of insects, moreover, indicate an action in flight quite
analogous to that of birds. I believe that a careful examination
will show that the wings of almost all insects are slightly
concave beneath. Further, they are all constructed with a
strong and rigid anterior margin, while the outer and hinder
margins are exceedingly thin and flexible. Yet further, I
feel confident (and a friend here agrees with me) that they
are much more rigid against <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">upward</span> than against <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">downward</span>
pressure. Now in most insects (take a butterfly as an
example) the body is weighted behind the insertion of the
wings by the long and heavy abdomen, so as to produce an
oblique position when freely suspended. There is also much
more wing surface behind than before the fulcrum. Now if
such an insect produces by muscular action a regular flapping
of the wings, flight must result. At the downward
stroke the pressure of the air against the hind wings would
raise them all to a nearly horizontal position, and at the
same time bend up their posterior margins a little, producing
an upward and onward motion. At the upward stroke the
pressure on the hind wings would depress them considerably
into an oblique position, and from their great flexibility in
that direction would bend down their hind margins. The
resultant would be a slightly downward and considerably
onward motion, the two strokes producing that undulating
flight so characteristic of butterflies, and so especially
observable in the broad-winged tropical species. Now all
this is quite conformable to the action of a bird&#39;s wing. The
<span class="tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span>
<a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rigid anterior margin, the slender and flexible hind margin;
the greater resistance to upward than to downward pressure,
and the slight concavity of the under surface, are all characters
common to the wings of birds and most insects, and,
considering the totally different structure and homologies of
the two, I think there is at least an <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">a priori</span> case for the function
they both subserve being dependent upon these peculiarities.
If I remember rightly, it is on these principles that the
Duke of Argyll has explained the flight of birds, in which,
however, there are of course some specialities depending
on the more perfect organisation of the wing, its greater
mobility and flexibility, its capacity for enlargement and
contraction, and the peculiar construction and arrangement
of the feathers. These, however, are matters of detail; and
there are no doubt many and important differences of detail
in the mode of flight of the different types of insects which
would require a special study of each. It appeared to me
that the Duke of Argyll had given that special study to the
flight of birds, and deserved praise for having done so successfully,
although he may not have quite solved the whole
problem, or have stated quite accurately the comparative
importance of the various causes that combine to effect flight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Wallace,‚ÄîI did not answer your last letter,
being busy in getting out my second edition of "First
Principles."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I was quite aware of the alleged additional cause of flight
which you name, and do not doubt that it is an aid. But I
regard it simply as an aid. If you will move an outstretched
wing backwards and forwards with equal velocity, I think
you will find that the difference of resistance is nothing like
<span class="tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span>
<a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
commensurate with the difference in size between the muscles
that raise the wings and the muscles that depress them. It
seems to me quite out of the question that the principles of
flight are fundamentally different in a bat and a bird, which
they must be if the Duke of Argyll&#39;s interpretation is correct.
I write, however, not so much to reply to your argument as
to correct a misapprehension which my expressions seem to
have given you. The objections are not made by Tyndall or
Huxley; but they are objections made by me, which I stated
to them, and in which they agreed‚ÄîTyndall expressing the
opinion that I ought to make them public. I name this

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Wallace,‚ÄîYou probably remember an article by
Agassiz in an American periodical, the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Christian Observer</span>,
on the diversity of human races, etc., to prove that each
distinct race was originally created for each zoological and
botanical province. But while he makes out a good case for
the circumscription of the principal races to distinct provinces,
he evades in a singular manner the community of the
Red Indian race to North and South America. He takes
pains to show that the same American race pervades North
and South America, or at least all America south of the
Arctic region. This was Dr. Morton&#39;s opinion, and is, I
suppose, not to be gainsaid. In other words, while the
Papuan, Indo-Malayan, Negro and other races are strictly
limited each of them to a particular region of mammalia,
the Red Indian type is common to Sclater&#39;s Neo-arctic and
Neo-tropical regions. Have you ever considered the explanation
<span class="tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span>
<a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of this fact on Darwinian principles? If there were
not barbarous tribes like the Fuegians, one might imagine
America to have been peopled when mankind was somewhat
more advanced and more capable of diffusing itself over an
entire continent. But I cannot well understand why isolation
such as accompanies a very low state of social progress
did not cause the Neo-tropical and Neo-arctic regions to
produce by varieties and Natural Selection two very different
human races. May it be owing to the smaller lapse of time,
which time, nevertheless, was sufficient to allow of the spread
of the representatives of one and the same type from Canada
to Cape Horn? Have you ever touched on this subject, or
can you refer me to anyone who has?‚ÄîBelieve me ever most

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir Charles,‚ÄîWhy the colour of man is sometimes
constant over large areas while in other cases it varies, we
cannot certainly tell; but we may well suppose it to be due
to its being more or less correlated with constitutional characters
favourable to life. By far the most common colour of
man is a warm brown, not very different from that of the
American Indian. White and black are alike deviations
from this, and are probably correlated with mental and
physical peculiarities which have been favourable to the increase
and maintenance of the particular race. I shall infer,
therefore, that the brown or red was the original colour of
man, and that it maintains itself throughout all climates in
America because accidental deviations from it have not been
accompanied by any useful constitutional peculiarities. It
is Bates&#39;s opinion that the Indians are recent immigrants
into the tropical plains of South America, and are not yet
fully acclimatised.‚ÄîYours faithfully,</p>

types worked round by the south, and altered rapidly as
<span class="tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Wallace,‚ÄîI have been waiting to thank you for
"Island Life" till I should have read it through as carefully
as I am digesting the chapters I have finished; but I
can delay no longer, if only to say that I heartily enjoy it,
and believe that you have brushed away more cobwebs that
have obscured the subject than any other, besides giving a
vast deal that is new, and admirably setting forth what
is old, so as to throw new light on the whole subject. It
is, in short, a first-rate book. I am making notes for
you, but hitherto have seen no defect of importance except
in the matter of the Bahamas, whose flora is Floridan, not
Cuban, in so far as we know it....‚ÄîVery truly yours,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Pen-y-bryn, St. Peter&#39;s Road, Croydon. January 7, 1881.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Thiselton-Dyer,‚ÄîIf I had had your lecture
before me when writing the last chapters of my book I should
certainly have quoted you in support of the view of the
northern origin of the Southern flora by migration along
existing continents. On reading it again I am surprised to
find how often you refer to this; but when I read it on its
first appearance I did not pay special attention to this point
except to note that your views agreed more closely with those
I had advanced, derived from the distribution of animals,
than those of any previous writer on botanical distribution.
When, at a much later period, on coming to the end of my
work, I determined to give a chapter to the New Zealand
flora in order to see how far the geological and physical relations
between New Zealand and Australia would throw light
on its origin, I went for my facts to the works of Sir Joseph
Hooker and Mr. Bentham, and also to your article in the
"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica," and worked out my conclusions
solely from these, and from the few facts referring to the
migration of plants which I had collected. Had I referred
again to your lecture I should certainly have quoted the cases
you give (in a note, p. 431) of plants extending along the
Andes from California to Peru and Chile, and vice versa.
Whatever identity there is in our views was therefore arrived
at independently, and it was an oversight on my part not
referring to your views, partly due to your not having made
them a more prominent feature of your very interesting and
instructive lecture. Working as I do at home, I am obliged
to get my facts from the few books I can get together; and I
only attempted to deal with these great botanical questions
because the facts seemed sufficiently broad and definite not to
be much affected by errors of detail or recent additions to our
<span class="tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span>
<a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
knowledge, and because the view which I took of the past
changes in Australia and New Zealand seemed calculated to
throw so much light upon them. Without such splendid
summaries of the relations of the Southern floras as are
given in Sir J. Hooker&#39;s Introductions, I should not have
touched the subject at all; and I venture to hope that you
or some of your colleagues will give us other such summaries,
brought down to the present date, of other important floras‚Äîas,
for example, those of South Africa and South Temperate
America.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Many thanks for additional peculiar British plants.

etc., I should like to send a corrected list to <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nature</span>, which

<p class="tei tei-p">P.S.‚ÄîMr. Darwin strongly objects to my view of the

along lowlands during cold periods. This latter view seems

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace was in frequent correspondence with Professor
Raphael Meldola, the eminent chemist, a friend both of
Darwin and of Wallace, a student of Evolution, and a stout
defender of Darwinism. I received from him much help and
advice in connection with this work, and had he lived until
its completion‚Äîhe died, suddenly, in 1914‚Äîmy indebtedness
to him would have been even greater.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The following letter to Meldola refers to a suggestion that
the white colour of the undersides of animals might have been
developed by selection through the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">physical</span> advantage gained
from the protection of the vital parts by a <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">lighter</span> colour and
therefore by a surface of less radiative activity. The idea
was that there would be less loss of animal heat through
such a white coating. We were at that time unaware of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span>
<a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Thayer&#39;s demonstration of the value of such colouring for
the purposes of concealment among environment. Wallace
accepted Thayer&#39;s view at once when it was subsequently
put forward; as do most naturalists at the present time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Meldola,‚ÄîI have just read your reply to
Romanes in <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nature</span>, and so far as your view goes I agree, but
it does not go far enough. Professor Newton has called my
attention to a passage in Belt&#39;s "Nicaragua," pp. 207-8, in
which he puts forth very clearly exactly your view. I find I
had noted the explanation as insufficient, and I hear that in
Darwin&#39;s copy there is "No! No!" against it. It seems,
however, to me to summarise <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all</span> that is of the slightest value
in Romanes&#39; wordy paper. I have asked Newton (to whom
I had lent it) to forward to you at Birmingham a proof of
my paper in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Fortnightly</span>, and I shall be much obliged
<span class="tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span>
<a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
if you will read it carefully, and, if you can, "hold a brief"
for me at the British Association in this matter. You will
see that a considerable part of my paper is devoted to a
demonstration of the fallacy of that part of "Romanes"
which declares species to be distinguished generally by useless
characters, and also that "simultaneous variations"
do not usually occur.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On the question of sterility, which, as you well observe,
is the core of the question, I think I show that it could not
work in the way Romanes puts it. The objection to Belt&#39;s
and your view is, also, that it would not work unless the
"sterility variation" was correlated with the "useful
variation." You assume, I think, this correlation, when you
speak of two of your varieties, B. and K., being <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">less fertile
with the parent form</span>. Without correlation they could not be
so, only some few of them. Romanes always speaks of his
physiological variations as being independent, "primary,"
in which case, as I show, they could hardly ever survive. At
the end of my paper I show a correlation which is probably
general and sufficient.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In criticising Romanes, however, at the British Association,
I want to call your special attention to a point I have
hardly made clear enough in my paper. Romanes always
speaks of the "physiological variety" as if it were like any
other <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">simple</span> variety, and could as easily (he says more easily)
be increased. Whereas it is really complex, requiring a remarkable
correlation between different sets of individuals
which he never recognises. To illustrate what I mean, let
me suppose a case. Let there occur in a species three individual
physiological varieties‚ÄîA, B and C‚Äîeach being
infertile with the bulk of the species, but quite fertile with
some small part of it. Let A, for example, be fertile with
X, Y and Z. Now I maintain it to be in the highest degree
improbable that B, a quite distinct individual, with distinct
<span class="tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span>
<a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
parents originating in a distinct locality, and perhaps with a
very different constitution, merely because it also is sterile
with the bulk of the species, should be fertile with the very
same individuals, X, Y, Z, that A is fertile with. It seems
to me to be at least 100 to 1 that it will be fertile with some
other quite distinct set of individuals. And so with C, and
any other similar variety. I express this by saying that each
has its "sexual complements," and that the complements of
the one are almost sure not to be the complements of the
other. Hence it follows that A, B, C, though differing in the
same character of general infertility with the bulk of the
species, will really be three distinct varieties physiologically,
and can in no way unite to form a single physiological
variety. This enormous difficulty Romanes apparently never
sees, but argues as if all individuals that are infertile with
the bulk of the species must be or usually are fertile with the
same set of individuals or with each other. This I call a
monstrous assumption, for which not a particle of evidence
exists. Take this in conjunction with my argument from
the severity of the struggle for existence and the extreme
improbability of the respective "sexual complements" coming
together at the right time, and I think Romanes&#39;
ponderous paper is disposed of.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I wrote my paper, however, quite as much to expose the
great presumption and ignorance of Romanes in declaring
that Natural Selection is <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">not</span> a theory of the origin of species‚Äîas
it is calculated to do much harm. See, for instance, the
way the Duke of Argyll jumped at it like a trout at a fly!‚ÄîYours

The only difficult case, that of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">D. euphorbi√¶</span>, is due probably

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mrs. Fisher,‚ÄîI know nothing of the physiology
of ferns and mosses, but as a matter of fact I think they
will be found to increase and diminish together all over
the world. Both like moist, equable climates and shade,
and are therefore both so abundant in oceanic islands, and
in the high regions of the tropics.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I am inclined to think that the reason ferns have persisted
so long in competition with flowering plants is the
fact that they thrive best in shade, flowers best in the light.
In our woods and ravines the flowers are mostly spring
flowers, which die away just as the foliage of the trees is
coming out and the shade deepens; while ferns are often
dormant at that time, but grow as the shade increases.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Why tree-ferns should not grow in cold countries I
know not, except that it may be the winds are too violent
and would tear all the fronds off before the spores were
ripe. Everywhere they grow in ravines, or in forests
where they are sheltered, even in the tropics. And they
are not generally abundant, but grow in particular zones
only. In all the Amazon valley I don&#39;t remember ever
having seen a tree-fern....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I too am struggling with my "Popular Sketch of Darwinism,"
and am just now doing a chapter on the great
"hybridity" question. I really think I shall be able to
arrange the whole subject more intelligibly than Darwin
did, and simplify it immensely by leaving out the endless
discussion of collateral details and difficulties which in the
"Origin of Species" confuse the main issue....

an old paper that I wrote twenty years ago, giving a

I think most probable) Natural Selection will accumulate
variations in infertility between incipient species. Many
other causes of infertility co-operate, and I really think I

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Meldola,‚ÄîMany thanks for your criticism. It
is a perfectly sound one as against my view being a <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">complete
explanation</span> of the phenomena, but that I do not
claim. And I do not see any chance of the required facts
being forthcoming for many years to come. Experiments
in the hybridisation of animals are so difficult and tedious
that even Darwin never undertook any, and the only people
who could and ought to have done it‚Äîthe Zoological Society‚Äîwill
not. There is one point, however, I think you have
overlooked. You urge the improbability of the required infertility
being correlated with the particular variations which
characterised each incipient species. But the whole point
of my argument is, that the physiological adjustments producing
fertility are so delicate that they are disturbed by
almost any variation or change of conditions‚Äîexcept in the
case of domestic animals, which have been domesticated
because they are not subject to this disturbance. The whole
first half of the chapter is to bring out this fact, which
Darwin has dwelt upon, and it certainly does afford a foundation
for the assumption that usually, and in some considerable
number of individuals, variation in nature, accompanied
by somewhat changed conditions of life, is accompanied by,
and probably correlated with, some amount of infertility.
No doubt this assumption wants proving, but in the meantime
I am glad you think that, granting the assumption, I
have shown that Natural Selection is able to accumulate
sterility variations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That is certainly a step in advance, and we cannot expect
<span class="tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Hemsley,‚ÄîYou are aware that Patrick Geddes
proposes to exclude Natural Selection in the origination of
thorns and spines, which he imputes to "diminishing vegetativeness"
or "ebbing vitality of the species." It has
occurred to me that insular floras should afford a test of
the correctness of this view, since in the absence of mammalia
the protection of spines would be less needed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Your study of these floras will no doubt enable you to
answer a few questions on this point. Spines and thorns
are, I believe, usually abundant in arid regions of continents,
especially in South Africa, where large herbivorous
mammals abound. Now, if the long-continued presence of
these mammals is a factor in the production of spines by
Natural Selection, they should be wholly or comparatively
absent in regions equally arid where there are no mammals.
The Galapagos seem to be such a case‚Äîalso perhaps
some of the Sandwich Islands, and generally the
extra-tropical volcanic islands. Also Australia comparatively,
and the highlands of Madagascar.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of course, the endemic species must be chiefly considered,
as they have had time to be modified by the conditions. If
you can give me the facts, or your general impression from
your study of these floras, I shall be much obliged. I see,
of course, many other objections to Geddes&#39;s theory, but

New Zealand may be for protection against land molluscs,

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Poulton,‚ÄîI returned you the two first of
Weismann&#39;s essays, with a few notes and corrections in
pencil on that on "Duration of Life." Looking over some
old papers, I have just come across a short sketch on two

Old Age, Decay and Death," written over twenty years
ago.<a name="noteref_17" id="noteref_17"></a><a href="#note_17"><span class="footnoteref">17</span></a> I had the same general idea as Weismann, but not
that beautiful suggestion of the duration of life, in each
case, being the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">minimum</span> necessary for the preservation of
the species. <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">That</span> I think masterly. The paper on

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Poulton,‚ÄîI return herewith (but separately)
the "proofs" I have of Weismann&#39;s Essays. The last
critical one is rather heavy, and adds nothing of importance
to the earlier one on Duration of Life. I enclose my
"Note" on the subject, which was written, I think, about
1867, certainly before 1870. You will see it was only a
few ideas jotted down for further elaboration and then
forgotten. I see however it <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">does</span> contain the germ of Weismann&#39;s
argument as to duration of life being determined
by the time of securing continuance of the species.‚ÄîYours

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Poulton,‚ÄîMy attention has been called
by Mr. Herdman, in his Inaugural Address to the Liverpool
Biological Society, to Galton&#39;s paper on "Heredity,"
which I read years ago but had forgotten. I have just
read it again (in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Journal of the Anthropological Institute</span>,
Vol. V., p. 329, Jan., 1876), and I find a remarkable
anticipation of Weismann&#39;s theories which I think should
be noticed in a preface to the translation of his book.<a name="noteref_18" id="noteref_18"></a><a href="#note_18"><span class="footnoteref">18</span></a> He
argues that it is the undeveloped germs or gemmules of the
fertilised ovum that form the sexual elements of the offspring,
and thus heredity and atavism are explained. He
<span class="tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span>
<a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
also argues that, as a corollary, "acquired modifications
are barely if at all inherited in the correct sense of the
word." He shows the imperfection of the evidence on this
point, and admits, just as Weismann does, the heredity of
changes in the parent like alcoholism, which, by permeating
the whole tissues, may <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">directly</span> affect the reproductive elements.
In fact, all the main features of Weismann&#39;s views
seem to be here anticipated, and I think he ought to have
the credit of it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Being no physiologist, his language is not technical,

Henslow, in his "Floral Structures,"<a name="noteref_19" id="noteref_19"></a><a href="#note_19"><span class="footnoteref">19</span></a> adopts the same

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Wallace,‚ÄîI send the paper with pleasure, and
am glad that you will read it, and I hope then see more
clearly than the abstract could show the grounds of my
argument.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">These finger-marks are most remarkable things. Of

writing that memoir. Indeed I have another paper on
them next Thursday at the Royal Society, but that only
refers to ways of cataloguing them, either for criminal
administration, or what I am more interested in, viz.
racial and hereditary inquiry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What I have done in this way is not ready for publication,
but I may mention (privately, please) that these persistent
marks, which seem fully developed in the sixth
month of foetal life, and appear under the reservations
and in the evidence published in the memoir to be practically
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">quite</span> unchanged during life, are <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">not</span> correlated with

<a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
any ordinary characteristic that I can discover. They are
the same in the lowest idiots as in ordinary persons. (I
took the impressions of some 80 of these, so idiotic that
they mostly could not speak, or even stand, at the great
Darenth Asylum, Dartford.) They are the same in clod-hoppers
as in the upper classes, and <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">yet</span> they are as hereditary
as other qualities, I think. Their tendency to symmetrical
distribution on the two hands is <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">marked</span>, and
symmetry <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">is</span> a form of kinship. My argument is that
sexual selection can have had nothing to do with the patterns,
neither can any other form of selection due to
vigour, wits, and so forth, because they are not correlated
with them. They just go their own gait, uninfluenced by

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Meldola,‚ÄîYou have now put your foot in it!
Romanes <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">agrees</span> with you! Henceforth he will claim you
as a disciple, converted by his arguments!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There was one admission in your letter I was very sorry
to see, because it cannot be strictly true, and is besides
open to much misrepresentation. I mean the admission
that Romanes pounces upon in his second paragraph. Of
course, the number of individuals in a species being finite,
the chance of four coincident variations occurring in any
one individual‚Äîeach such variation being separately very
common‚Äîcannot be anything like "infinity to one." Why,
then, do you concede it most fully?‚Äîthe result being that
Romanes takes you to concede that it is infinity to one
against the coincident variations occurring in "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">any individuals</span>."
Surely, with the facts of coincident independent
variation we now possess, the occurrence of three,
four, or five, coincident variations cannot be otherwise
than frequent. As a fact, more than half the whole population
of most species seems to vary to a perceptible and
measurable, and therefore sufficient, amount in scores of
ways. Take a species with a million pairs of individuals‚Äîhalf
of these vary sufficiently, either + or -, in the four
acquired characters A, B, C, D: what will be the proportion
of individuals that vary + in these four characters
<span class="tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span>
<a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
according to the law of averages? Will it not be about
1 in 64? If so it is ample‚Äîin many cases‚Äîfor Natural
Selection to work on, because in many cases less than 1/64
of offspring survives.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On Romanes&#39; view of the impossibility of Natural Selection
doing anything alone, because the required coincident
variations do not occur, the occurrence of a "strong man"
or a racehorse that beats all others easily must be impossible,
since in each of these cases there must be scores of
coincident favourable variations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Given sufficient variation, I believe divergent modification
of a species in two lines could easily occur, even if
free intercrossing occurred, because, the numbers varying
being a large proportion of the whole, the numbers which
bred like with like would he sufficient to carry on the two
lines of divergence, those that intercrossed and produced
less perfectly adapted offspring being eliminated. Of course
some amount of segregate breeding does always occur, as
Darwin always maintained, but, as he also maintained, it
is not absolutely essential to evolution. Romanes argues
as if "free intercrossing" meant that none would pair
like with like! I hope you will have another slap at him,
and withdraw or explain that unlucky "infinity to one,"
which is Romanes&#39; sheet-anchor.‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span>
<a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">weakest and most inconclusive</span> thing he has yet written.
At p. 17 he states his theory as to degeneration of eyes,
and again, on p. 18, of anthers and filaments; but in both
cases he fails to <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">prove</span> it, and apparently does not see
that his panmixia, or "cessation of selection," cannot possibly
produce <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">continuous</span> degeneration culminating in the
total or almost total disappearance of an organ. Romanes
and others have pointed out this weakness in his theory,
but he does not notice it, and goes on calmly throughout
the essay to <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">assume</span> that mere panmixia must cause progressive
degeneration to an unlimited extent; whereas all
it can do is to effect a reduction to the average of the total
population on which selection has been previously worked.
He says "individuals with weak eyes would not be eliminated,"
but omits to notice that individuals with strong
eyes would also "not be eliminated," and as there is no
reason alleged why variations in <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all directions</span> should not
occur as before, the free intercrossing would tend to keep
up a mean condition only a little below that which was
kept up by selection. It is clear that some form of selection
must always co-operate in degeneration, such as
economy of growth, which he hardly notices except as a
possible but not a necessary factor, or actual injuriousness.
It appears to me that what is wanted is to take a
number of typical cases, and in each of them show how
Natural Selection comes in to carry on the degeneration
begun by panmixia. Weismann&#39;s treatment of the subject
is merely begging the question.‚ÄîYours faithfully,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Poulton,‚ÄîAs to panmixia you have quite
misunderstood my position. By the "mean condition," I
<span class="tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span>
<a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
do not mean the "mean" during the whole course of development
of the organ, as you seem to take it. That would
indeed be absurd. I do mean the "mean" of the whole
series of individual variations now occurring, during a
period sufficient to contain all or almost all the variations
to which the species is <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">now</span> subject. Take, for instance,
such a case as the wings of the swallow, on the full development
of which the life of the bird depends. Many
individuals no doubt perish for lack of wing-power, due to
deficiency in size or form of wing, or in the muscles which
move it. The extreme limits of variation would be seen
probably if we examined every swallow that had reached
maturity during the last century. The average of all those
would perhaps be 5 or 10 per cent. below the average of
those that survive to become the parents of the next generation
in any year; and what I maintain is, that panmixia
alone could not reduce a swallow&#39;s wings below this first
average. Any further reduction must be due either to
some form of selection or to "economy of growth"‚Äîwhich
is also, fundamentally, a form of selection. So with the
eyes of cave animals, panmixia could only cause an imperfection
of vision equal to the average of those variations
which occurred, say, during a century before the animal
entered the cave. It could only produce more effect than
this if the effects of disuse are hereditary‚Äîwhich is a non-Weismannian
doctrine. I think this is also the position
that Romanes took.‚ÄîYours faithfully,</p>

The modern scientific morphologists seem so wholly occupied

life, which result in such infinitely varied structures and such
strange habits and so-called instincts. The older I grow the

habit in plants and animals, and the unerring certitude with
which from a minute germ the whole complex organism is
built up, true to the type of its kind in all the infinitude of

was caused by his five years sea-sickness. It was thoroughly
established before, and in the early years of, his
marriage, and, on his own theory his children ought all
to have inherited it. Have they? You know perhaps
better than I do, whether any of the family show any
symptoms of that particular form of illness‚Äîand if not it
is a fine case!‚ÄîYours very faithfully,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Meldola,‚ÄîAs we had no time to "discourse"
on Thursday, I will say a few words on the individual adaptability
question. We have to deal with facts, and facts certainly
show that, in many groups, there is a great amount
of adaptable change produced in the individual by external
conditions, and that that change is not inherited. I do not
see that this places Natural Selection in any subordinate
position, because this individual adaptability is evidently
advantageous to many species, and may itself have been
produced or increased by Natural Selection. When a
species is subject to great changes of conditions, either
locally or at uncertain times, it may be a decided advantage
to it to become individually adapted to that change
while retaining the power to revert instantly to its original
form when the normal conditions return. But whenever
the changed conditions are permanent, or are such that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span>
<a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
individual adaptation cannot meet the requirements, then
Natural Selection rapidly brings about a permanent adaptation
which is inherited. In plants these two forms of
adaptation are well marked and easily tested, and we
shall soon have a large body of evidence upon it. In the
higher animals I imagine that individual adaptation is
small in amount, as indicated by the fact that even slight
varieties often breed true.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In Lepidoptera we have the two forms of colour-adaptability
clearly shown. Many species are, in all their stages,
permanently adapted to their environment. Others have
a certain power of individual adaptation, as of the pup√¶
to their surroundings. If this last adaptation were strictly
inherited it would be positively injurious, since the progeny
would thereby lose the power of individual adaptability,
and thus we should have light pup√¶ on dark surroundings,
and vice versa. Each kind of adaptation has its own sphere,
and it is essential that the one should be non-inheritable, the
other heritable. The whole thing seems to me quite harmonious
and "as it should be."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Thiselton-Dyer tells me that H. Spencer is dreadfully
disturbed on the question. He fears that acquired characters
may not be inherited, in which case the foundation of
his whole philosophy is undermined!‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Poulton,‚ÄîThe letter I wrote to you at Nottingham
was returned to me here (after a month), so I did not
think it worth while to send it to you again, though it did
contain my congratulations on your appointment,<a name="noteref_23" id="noteref_23"></a><a href="#note_23"><span class="footnoteref">23</span></a> which I
now repeat. As you have not seen the paper I sent to the
British Association, I will just say that I should not have
noticed the subject publicly but, after a friend had given
me the photographs (sent with my paper), I came across
the following statement in the new edition of Chambers&#39;
Encyclop√¶dia, art. Deformities (by Prof. A. Hare): "In
an increasing proportion of cases which are carefully investigated,
it appears that maternal impressions, the result
of shock or unpleasant experiences, may have a considerable
influence in producing deformities in the offspring."
In consequence of this I sent the case which had been
<span class="tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span>
<a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
furnished me, and which is certainly about as well
attested and conclusive as anything can be. The facts are
these:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A gamekeeper had his right forearm amputated at the
North Devon Infirmary. He left before it was healed,
thinking his wife could dress it, but as she was too nervous,
a neighbour, a young recently married woman, a farmer&#39;s
wife, still living, came and dressed it every day till it
healed. About six months after she had a child born <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">without
right hand and forearm</span>, the stump exactly corresponding
in length to that of the gamekeeper. Dr. Richard
Budd, M.D., F.R.C.P.,<a name="noteref_24" id="noteref_24"></a><a href="#note_24"><span class="footnoteref">24</span></a> of Barnstaple, the physician to
the infirmary, when the boy was five or six years old, himself
took a photograph of the boy and the gamekeeper side
by side, showing the wonderful correspondence of the two
arms. I have these facts <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">direct from Dr. Budd</span>, who was
personally cognisant of the whole circumstances. A few
years after, in November, 1876, Dr. Budd gave an account
of the case and exhibited the photographs to a large meeting
at the College of Physicians, and I have no doubt it
is <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">one</span> of the cases referred to in the article I have quoted,
though Dr. Budd thinks it has never been published. It
will be at once admitted that this is not a chance coincidence,
and that all theoretical difficulties must give way
to such facts as this, ... Of course it by no means follows
that similar causes should in all cases produce similar
effects, since the idiosyncrasy of the mother is no doubt
an important factor; but where the combined coincidences
are so numerous as in this case‚Äî<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">place, time, person</span> and

agree on many, and one of the points on which we doubtless
agree is the absurdity of Lord Salisbury&#39;s representation of
the process of Natural Selection based upon the improbability
of two varying individuals meeting. His nonsensical
representation of the theory ought to be exposed, for it will
mislead very many people. I see it is adopted by the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Pall

matter up, but it is evidently your business to do that. Pray
write a letter to the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Times</span> explaining that selection or survival
of the fittest does not necessarily take place in the
way he describes. You might set out by remarking that
whereas he begins by comparing himself to a volunteer
colonel reviewing a regiment of regulars, he very quickly
changes his attitude and becomes a colonel of regulars reviewing
volunteers and making fun of their bunglings.
He deserves a-severe castigation. There are other points

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Poulton,‚ÄîI have read your paper on "Theories
of Evolution"<a name="noteref_27" id="noteref_27"></a><a href="#note_27"><span class="footnoteref">27</span></a> with great pleasure. It is very clear and
very forcible, and I should think must have opened the eyes
of some of your hearers. Your cases against Lamarckism
were very strong, and I think quite conclusive. There is
one, however, which seems to me weak‚Äîthat about the claws
of lobsters and the tails of lizards moving and acting when
detached from the body. It may be argued, fairly, that this
is only an incidental result of the extreme muscular irritability
and contractibility of the organs, which might have
been caused on Lamarckian as well as on the Darwinian
hypothesis. The running of a fowl after its head is chopped
off is an example of the same kind of thing, and this is
certainly not useful. The detachment itself of claw and
tail is no doubt useful and adaptive.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When discussing the objection as to failures not being
found fossil, there are two additional arguments to those
you adduce: (1) Every failure has been, first, a success, or
it could not have come into existence (as a species); and (2)
<span class="tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span>
<a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the hosts of huge and very specialised animals everywhere
recently extinct are clearly failures. They were successes
as long as the struggle was with animal competitors only,
physical conditions being highly favourable. But, when
physical conditions became adverse, as by drought, cold, etc.,
they failed and became extinct. The entrance of new
enemies from another area might equally render them
failures. As to your question about myself and Darwin, I

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Poulton,‚ÄîI have now nearly finished reading
Romanes, but do not find it very convincing. There is a
large amount of special pleading. On two points only I feel
myself hit. My doubt that Darwin really meant that <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all</span> the
individuals of a species could be similarly modified without
selection is evidently wrong, as he adduces other quotations
which I had overlooked. The other point is, that my suggested
explanation of sexual ornaments gives away my case
as to the utility of all specific characters. It certainly does
as it stands, but I now believe, and should have added, that
all these ornaments, where they differ from species to species,
are also recognition characters, and as such were rendered
stable by Natural Selection from their first appearance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I rather doubt the view you state, and which Gulick and
Romanes make much of, that a portion of a species, separated
from the main body, will have a different average of characters,
unless they are a local race which has already been
somewhat selected. The large amount of variation, and the
regularity of the curve of variation, whenever about 50 or
100 individuals are measured in the same locality, shows
that the bulk of a species are similar in amount of variation
everywhere. But when a portion of a species begins to be
modified in adaptation to new conditions, distinction of
some kind is essential, and therefore any slight difference
<span class="tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span>
<a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would be increased by selection. I see no reason to believe
that species (usually) have been isolated first and modified
afterwards, but rather that new species usually arise from
species which have a wide range, and in different areas need
somewhat different characters and habits. Then <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">distinctness</span>
arises both by adaptation and by development of recognition
marks to minimise intercrossing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I wonder Darwin did not see that if the unknown "constant
causes" he supposes can modify all the individuals of
a species, either indifferently, usefully, or hurtfully, and that
these characters so produced are, as Romanes says, very,
very numerous in all species, and are sometimes the only
specific characters, then the Neo-Lamarckians are quite right
in putting Natural Selection as a very secondary and subordinate
influence, since all it has to do is to weed out the
hurtful variations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Of course, if a species with warning colours were, in part,
completely isolated, and its colours or markings were accidentally
different from the parent form, whatever set of
markings and colours it had would be, I consider, rendered
stable for recognition, and also for protection, since if it
varied too much the young birds and other enemies would
take a heavier toll in learning it was uneatable. It might
then be said that the character by which this species differs
from the parent species is a useless character. But surely
this is not what is usually meant by a "useless character."
This is highly useful in itself, though the difference from
the other species is not useful. If they were in contact it
would be useful, as a distinction preventing intercrossing,
and so long as they are not brought together we cannot really
tell if it is a species at all, since it might breed freely with
the parent form and thus return back to one type. The
"useless characters" I have always had in mind when arguing
this question are those which are or are supposed to be
<span class="tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span>
<a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
absolutely useless, not merely relatively as regards the difference
from an allied species. I think this is an important
distinction.‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

indicate abrupt or continuous motion, have corresponding
meanings in so many cases as to show a fundamental connection.
I thus enormously extended the principle of onomatopoeia
in the origin of vocal language. As I have been
unable to find any reference to this important factor in
the origin of language, and as no competent writer has
pointed out any fallacy in it, I think I am justified in
supposing it to be new and important. Mr. Gladstone informed
me that there were many thousands of illustrations
of my ideas in Homer."‚ÄîA.R.W.</p>

article draws on you the inconvenience of an

<p class="tei tei-p">My pursuits in connection with Homer, especially, have
made me a confident advocate of the doctrine that there is,
within limits, a connection in language between sound and

<p class="tei tei-p">I would consent to take the issue simply on English words

We know a good deal of the senses of the higher animals,

<h3 class="tei tei-head">TO PROF. MELDOLA</h3>


<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Parkstone, Dorset. October 12, 1896.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Meldola,‚ÄîI got Weismann&#39;s "Germinal Selection"
two or three months back and read it very carefully,
and on the whole I admire it very much, and think it does
complete the work of ordinary variation and selection. Of
course it is a pure hypothesis, and can never perhaps be
directly proved, but it seems to me a reasonable one, and it
<span class="tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span>
<a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
enables us to understand two groups of facts which I have
never been able to work out satisfactorily by the old method.
These two facts are: (1) the total, or almost total, disappearance
of many useless organs, and (2) the continuous
development of secondary sexual characters beyond any conceivable
utility, and, apparently, till checked by inutility. It
explains both these. Disuse alone, as I and many others
have always argued, cannot do the first, but can only cause
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">regression to the mean</span>, with perhaps some further regression
from economy of material.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As to the second, I have always felt the difficulty of
accounting for the enormous development of the peacock&#39;s
train, the bird of paradise plumes, the long wattle of the
bell bird, the enormous tail-feathers of the Guatemalan
trogon, of some humming-birds, etc. etc. etc. The beginnings
of all these I can explain as recognition marks, and
this explains also their distinctive character in allied species,
but it does not explain their growing on and on far beyond
what is needful for recognition, and apparently till limited
by absolute hurtfulness. It is a relief to me to have "germinal
selection" to explain this.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I do not, however, think it at all necessary to explain
adaptations, however complex. Variation is so general and
so large, in dominant species, and selection is so tremendously
powerful, that I believe all needful adaptation may be
produced without it. But, if it exists, it would undoubtedly
hasten the process of such adaptation and would therefore
enable new places in the economy of nature to be more
rapidly filled up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I was thinking of writing a popular exposition of the new
theory for <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nature</span>, but have not yet found time or inclination
for it. I began reading "Germinal Selection" with a
prejudice against it. That prejudice continued through the
first half, but when I came to the idea itself, and after some
<span class="tei-pb" id="page070">[pg 070]</span>
<a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
trouble grasped the meaning and bearing of it, I saw the
work it would do and was a convert at once. It really has
no relation to Lamarckism, and leaves the non-heredity of
acquired characters exactly where it was.‚ÄîYours very
truly,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">ALFRED R. WALLACE.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">

<p class="tei tei-p">The next letter relates to the great controversy then being
carried on with respect to Weismann&#39;s doctrine of the non-inheritance
of "acquired" characters, which doctrine implied
complete rejection of the last trace of Lamarckism
from Darwinian evolution. Wallace ultimately accepted
the Weismannian teaching. Darwin had no opportunity
during his lifetime of considering this question, which was
raised later in an acute form by Weismann.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Meldola,‚ÄîThe passage to which you refer in the
"Origin" (top of p. 6) shows Darwin&#39;s firm belief in the
"heredity of acquired variations," and also in the importance
of definite variations, that is, "sports," though elsewhere
he almost gives these up in favour of indefinite
variations; and this last is now the view of all Darwinians,
and even of many Lamarckians. I therefore
always now assume this as admitted. Weismann&#39;s view
as to "possible variations" and "impossible variations"
on p. 1 of "Germinal Selection" is misleading,
because it can only refer to "sports" or to "cumulative
results," not to "individual variations" such as are the
material Natural Selection acts on. Variation, as I understand
it, can only be a slight modification in the offspring
of that which exists in the parent. The question whether
pigs could possibly develop wings is absurd, and altogether
beside the question, which is, solely, so far as direct evidence
goes, as to the means by which the change from one species
<span class="tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span>
<a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to another closely allied species has been brought about.
Those who want to begin by discussing the causes of change
from a dog to a seal, or from a cow to a whale, are not worth
arguing with, as they evidently do not comprehend the
A, B, C of the theory.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Darwin&#39;s ineradicable acceptance of the theory of heredity
of the effects of climate, use and disuse, food, etc., on the
individual led to much obscurity and fallacy in his arguments,
here and there.‚ÄîYours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Poulton,‚ÄîThanks for copy of your British Association
Address,<a name="noteref_29" id="noteref_29"></a><a href="#note_29"><span class="footnoteref">29</span></a> which I did not read in <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nature</span>, being very
busy just then. I have now read it with much pleasure, and
think it a very useful and excellent discussion that was much
needed. There is, however, one important error, I think,
which vitiates a vital part of the argument, and which
renders it possible so to reduce the time indicated by geology
as to render the accordance of Geology and Physics more easy
to effect. The error I allude to was made by Sir A. Geikie
in his Presidential Address<a name="noteref_30" id="noteref_30"></a><a href="#note_30"><span class="footnoteref">30</span></a> which you quote. Immediately
it appeared I wrote to him pointing it out, but he merely
acknowledged my letter, saying he would consider it. To me
it seems a most palpable and extraordinary blunder. The
error consists in taking the rate of deposition as the same
as the rate of denudation, whereas it is about twenty times
as great, perhaps much more‚Äîbecause the area of deposition
is at least twenty times less than that of denudation. In
order to equal the area of denudation, it would require that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span>
<a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">every</span> bed of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">every</span> formation should have once extended over
the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">whole area</span> of all the land of the globe! The deposition
in narrow belts along coasts of all the matter brought down
by rivers, as proved by the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Challenger</span>, leads to the same
result. In my "Island Life," 2nd Edit., pp. 221-225, I have
discussed this whole matter, and on reading it again I can
find no fallacy in it. I have, however, I believe, overestimated
the time required for deposition, which I believe
would be more nearly one-fortieth than one-twentieth that of
mean denudation; because there is, I believe, also a great
overestimate of the maximum of deposition, because it is
partly made up of beds which may have been deposited
simultaneously. Also the maximum thickness is probably
double the mean thickness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The mean rate of denudation, both for European rivers
and for all the rivers that have been measured, is a foot in
three million years, which is the figure that should be taken
in calculations.‚ÄîBelieve me yours very truly,</p>

for him, and I agree with most of it, except his high estimate
of Spencer&#39;s co-adaptation argument. It is quite true that
Spencer&#39;s biology rests entirely on Lamarckism, so far as
heredity of acquired characters goes. I have been reading
Weismann&#39;s last book, "The Germ Plasm." It is a wonderful
attempt to solve the most complex of all problems, and is

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Poulton,‚Äî ... The rate of deposition might
be modified in an archipelago, but would not necessarily be
less than now, on the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">average</span>. On the ocean side it might be
slow, but wherever there were comparatively narrow straits
between the islands it might be even faster than now, because
the area of deposition would be strictly limited. In the seas
between Java and Borneo and between Borneo and Celebes
the deposition <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">may be</span> above the average. Again, during the
development of continents there were evidently extensive
mountain ridges and masses with landlocked seas, or inland
lakes, and in all these deposition would be rapid.
Anyhow, the fact remains that there is no necessary equality
between rates of denudation and deposition (in thickness)
as Geikie has <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">assumed</span>.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I was delighted with your account of Prichard&#39;s wonderful
anticipation of Galton and Weismann! It is so perfect
and complete.... It is most remarkable that such a complete
statement of the theory and such a thorough appreciation
of its effects and bearing should have been so long overlooked.
I read Prichard when I was very young, and have
never seen the book since. His facts and arguments are
really useful ones, and I should think Weismann must be
delighted to have such a supporter come from the grave. His
view as to the supposed transmission of disease is quite that
of Archdall Reid&#39;s recent book. He was equally clear as to
Selection, and had he been a <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">zoologist</span> and <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">traveller</span> he might
have anticipated the work of both Darwin and Weismann!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Meldola,‚Äî ... I am now reading a wonderfully
interesting book‚ÄîO. Fisher&#39;s "Physics of the Earth&#39;s

mathematics, is so clearly explained and so full
of good reasoning on all the aspects of this most difficult
question that it is a pleasure to read it. It was especially
a pleasure to me because I had just been writing an article

the Editor of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Natural Science</span>, who told me I was not orthodox
on the point. But I find that Fisher supports the same
view with very great force, and it strikes me that if weight
of argument and number of capable supporters create orthodoxy
in science, it is the other side who are not orthodox.
I have some fresh arguments, and I was delighted to be able
to quote Fisher. It seems almost demonstrated now that
Sir W. Thomson was wrong, and that the earth <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">has</span> a molten

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Sir,‚ÄîMy own opinion has long been‚Äîand I have
many times given reasons for it‚Äîthat there is always an
ample amount of variation in all directions to allow any
useful modification to be produced, very rapidly, as compared
with the rate of those secular changes (climate and
geography) which necessitate adaptation; hence no guidance
of variation in certain lines is necessary. For proof of this
I would ask you to look at the diagrams in Chapter III. of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span>
<a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
my "Darwinism," reading the explanation in the text. The
proof of such constant indefinite variability has been much
increased of late years, and if you consider that instead
of tens or hundreds of individuals, Nature has as many
thousands or millions to be selected from, every year or
two, it will be clear that the materials for adaptation are
ample.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Again, I believe that the time, even as limited by Lord
Kelvin&#39;s calculations, is ample, for reasons given in
Chapter X., "On the Earth&#39;s Age," in my "Island Life,"
and summed up on p. 236. I therefore consider the difficulty
set forth on p. 2 of the leaflet you send is not a real one. To
my mind, the development of plants and animals from low
forms of each is fully explained by the variability proved to
exist, with the actual rapid multiplication and Natural
Selection. For this no other intellectual agency is required.
The problem is to account for the infinitely complex constitution
of the material world and its forces which rendered
living organisms possible; then, the introduction of consciousness
or sensation, which alone rendered the animal
world possible; lastly, the presence in man of capacities and
moral ideas and aspirations which could not conceivably be
produced by variation and Natural Selection. This is stated
at p. 473-8 of my "Darwinism," and is also referred to in
the article I enclose (at p. 443) and which you need not
return.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The subject is so large and complex that it is not to be
wondered so many people still maintain the insufficiency of
Natural Selection, without having really mastered the facts.
I could not, therefore, answer your question without going
into some detail and giving references.... ‚ÄîBelieve me

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Ridley,‚Äî ... We are much interested now
about De Rougemont, and I dare say you have seen his story
in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Wide World Magazine</span>, while in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Daily Chronicle</span>
there have been letters, interviews and discussions without
end. A few people, who think they know everything, treat
him as an impostor; but unfortunately they themselves contradict
each other, and so far are proved to be wrong more
often than De Rougemont. I firmly believe that his story
is substantially true‚Äîmaking allowance for his being a
foreigner who learnt one system of measures, then lived
thirty years among savages, and afterwards had to reproduce
all his knowledge in English and Australian idioms.
As an intelligent writer in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Saturday Review</span> says, putting
aside the sensational illustrations there is absolutely
nothing in his story but what is quite <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">possible</span> and even

Jensen is said now to be in British New Guinea, and
has often spoken of his lost cargo of pearls. ‚Äî‚Äî and ‚Äî‚Äî,

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir,‚ÄîI trust you will forgive a stranger troubling
you with a letter, but a friend has asked me whether, as a
matter of fact, Darwin held that <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all</span> living creatures descended
from one and the same ancestor, and that the
pedigree of a humming-bird and that of a hippopotamus
would meet if traced far enough back. Can you tell me
whether Darwin did teach this?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I should have thought that as life was developed
once, it probably could and would be developed many
times in different places, as month after month, and year
after year went by; and that, from the very first, it
probably took many different forms and characters, in the
same way as crystals take different forms and shapes, even
when composed of the same substance. From these many
developments of "life" would descend as many separate
lines of evolution, one ending in the humming-bird, another
in the hippopotamus, a third in the kangaroo, etc., and their
pedigrees (however far back they might be traced) would not
join until they reached some primitive form of protoplasm,‚ÄîYours
faithfully,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir,‚ÄîDarwin believed that all living things originated
from "a few forms or from one"‚Äîas stated in the last
sentence of his "Origin of Species." But privately I am
sure he believed in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">one</span> origin. Of course there is a
possibility that there were several distinct origins from inorganic
matter, but that is very improbable, because in that
case we should expect to find some difference in the earliest

<a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
forms of the germs of life. But there is no such difference,
the primitive germ-cells of man, fish or oyster being almost
indistinguishable, formed of identical matter and going
through identical primitive changes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As to the humming-bird and hippopotamus, there is no
doubt whatever of a common origin‚Äîif evolution is accepted

organism whose ancestral forms can be traced back to a
simple type much earlier than the common origin of mammals,

it to enforce the somewhat similar opinion of your

"Analogy may be a deceitful guide." But I really do not
go so far as he did. For he maintained that there was not
any proof that the several great classes or kingdoms were
descended from common ancestors.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I maintain, on the contrary, that all without exception
are now proved to have originated by "descent with modification,"

the very same causes which have been sufficient to produce
all the species of a genus or Order were those which initiated
and developed the greater differences. At the same time I

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Darwin,‚ÄîI return you the two articles on
"Mutation" with many thanks. As they are both supporters
of de Vries, I suppose they put his case as strongly
as possible. Professor Hubrecht&#39;s paper is by far the
clearest and the best written, and he says distinctly that
de Vries claims that all new species have been produced by
mutations, and none by "fluctuating variations." Professor
Hubrecht supports this and says that de Vries has proved it!
And all this founded upon a few "sports" from one species
of plant, itself of doubtful origin (variety or hybrid), and
offering phenomena in no way different from scores of
other cultivated plants. Never, I should think, has such
a vast hypothetical structure been erected on so flimsy a
basis!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The boldness of his statements is amazing, as when he
declares (as if it were a fact of observation) that fluctuating
variability, though he admits it as the origin of all domestic
animals and plants, yet "never leads to the formation of
species"! (Hubrecht, p. 216.) There is one point where
he so grossly misinterprets your father that I think you or
some other botanist should point it out. De Vries is said to
quote from "Life and Letters," II., p. 83, where Darwin
refers to "chance variations"‚Äîexplained three lines on as
"the slight differences selected by which a race or species is
at length formed." Yet de Vries and Hubrecht claim that by
"chance variations" Darwin meant "sports" or "mutations,"
and therefore agrees with de Vries, while both omit
to refer to the many passages in which, later, he gave less
and less weight to what he termed "single large variations"‚Äîthe
same as de Vries&#39; "mutations"!‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Broadstone, Wimborne. November 10, 1905.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Sir Joseph,‚ÄîI am writing to apologise for a
great oversight. When I sent my publishers a list of persons
who had contributed to "My Life" in various ways, your
name, which should have been <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">first</span>, was strangely omitted,
and the omission was only recalled to me yesterday by reading
your letters to Bates in Clodd&#39;s edition of his Amazon
book, which I have just purchased. I now send you a copy
by parcel-post, in the hope that you will excuse the omission
to send it sooner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now for a more interesting subject, I was extremely
pleased and even greatly surprised, in reading your letters
to Bates, to find that at that early period (1862) you were
already strongly convinced of three facts which are absolutely
essential to a comprehension of the method of organic
evolution, but which many writers, even now, almost wholly
ignore. They are (1) the universality and large amount
of normal variability, (2) the extreme rigour of Natural
Selection, and (3) that there is no adequate evidence
for, and very much against, the inheritance of acquired
characters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was only some years later, when I began to write on
the subject and had to think out the exact mode of action of
Natural Selection, that I myself arrived at (1) and (2), and
have ever since dwelt upon them‚Äîin season and out of
season, as many will think‚Äîas being absolutely essential to
a comprehension of organic evolution. The third I did
not realise till I read Weismann, I have never seen the
sufficiency of normal variability for the modification of
species more strongly or better put than in your letters
to Bates. Darwin himself never realised it, and consequently
played into the hands of the "discontinuous
<span class="tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span>
<a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
variation" and "mutation" men, by so continually saying
"<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">if</span> they vary"‚Äî"without variation Natural Selection
can do nothing," etc.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Your argument that variations are not caused by change
of environment is equally forcible and convincing. Has
anybody answered de Vries yet?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">F. Darwin lent me Prof. Hubrecht&#39;s review from the
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Popular Science Monthly</span>, in which he claims that de Vries
has proved that new species have always been produced
from "mutations," never through normal variability, and
that Darwin latterly agreed with him! This is to me
amazing! The Americans too accept de Vries as a second
Darwin!‚ÄîYours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Wallace,‚ÄîMy return from a short holiday at
Sidmouth last Thursday was greeted by your kind and welcome
letter and copy of your "Life." The latter was, I
assure you, never expected, knowing as I do the demand
for free copies that such a work inflicts on the writer. In
fact I had put it down as one of the annual Christmas gifts
of books that I receive from my own family. Coming, as
it thus did, quite unexpectedly, it is doubly welcome,
and I do heartily thank you for this proof of your greatly
valued friendship. It will prove to be one of four works
of greatest interest to me of any published since Darwin&#39;s
"Origin," the others being Waddell&#39;s "Lhasa," Scott&#39;s
"Antarctic Voyage," and Mill&#39;s "Siege of the South
Pole."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I have not seen Clodd&#39;s edition of Bates&#39;s "Amazon,"
which I have put down as to be got, and I had no idea
that I should have appeared in it. Your citation of my
letters and their contents are like dreams to me; but to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span>
<a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tell you the truth, I am getting dull of memory as well
as of hearing, and what is worse, in reading: what goes
in at one eye goes out at the other. So I am getting to
realise Darwin&#39;s consolation of old age, that it absolves me
from being expected to know, remember, or reason upon
new facts and discoveries. And this must apply to your
query as to anyone having as yet answered de Vries. I
cannot remember having seen any answer; only criticisms
of a discontinuous sort. I cannot for a moment entertain
the idea that Darwin ever assented to the proposition that
new species have always been produced from mutation and
never through normal variability. Possibly there is some
quibble on the definition of mutation or of variation. The
Americans are prone to believe any new things, witness
their swallowing the thornless cactus produced by that
man in California‚ÄîI forget his name‚Äîwhich Kew exposed
by asking for specimens to exhibit in the Cactus
House....‚ÄîI am, my dear Wallace, sincerely yours,</p>

which we poor Darwinians must hide our diminished heads!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wishing to know the best that could be said for these
latter-day anti-Darwinians, I have just been reading Lock&#39;s
book on "Variation, Heredity, and Evolution." In the early
part of his book he gives a tolerably fair account of Natural
Selection, etc. But he gradually turns to Mendelism as the
"one thing needful"‚Äîstating that there can be "no sort
of doubt" that Mendel&#39;s paper is the "most important"
contribution of its size ever made to biological science!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Mutation," as a theory, is absolutely nothing new‚Äîonly
the assertion that new species originate <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">always</span> in
sports, for which the evidence adduced is the most meagre
and inconclusive of any ever set forth with such pretentious
claims! I hope you will thoroughly expose this absurd
claim.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mendelism is something new, and within its very limited

with the way you expose the Mendelian and Mutational
absurd claims. That ought to really open the eyes
of the newspaper men to the fact that Natural Selection
and Darwinism are not only holding their ground but are
becoming more firmly established than ever by every fresh
research into the ways and workings of living nature. I
shall look forward to great pleasure in reading the whole

<p class="tei tei-p">I see in Essay X. you use in the title the term "defensive
coloration." Why this instead of the usual "protective"?
Surely the whole function of such colours and markings is
to protect from attack‚Äînot to defend when attacked. The
latter is the function of stings, spines and hard coats. I
only mention this because using different terms may lead
to some misconception.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Your illustration of mutation by throwing colours on a
screen, and the argument founded on it, I liked much.
That reminds me that H. Spencer&#39;s argument for inheritance
of acquired variations‚Äîthat co-ordination of many
parts at once, required for adaptations, would be impossible
by chance variations of those parts‚Äîapplies with a
hundredfold force to mutations, which are admittedly so
much less frequent both in their numbers and the repetitions

the case of feathers reproduced annually, which I gave

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir William,‚ÄîOn Saturday, to my great pleasure,
I received a copy of the Darwin Commemoration volume.
I at once began reading your most excellent paper on the
Geographical Distribution of Plants. It is intensely interesting
to me, both because it so clearly brings out
Darwin&#39;s views and so judiciously expounds his arguments‚Äîeven
when you intimate a difference of opinion‚Äîbut
especially because you bring out so clearly and strongly
his views on the general permanence of continents and
oceans, which to-day, as much as ever, wants insisting
upon. I may just mention here that none of the people
who still insist on former continents where now are deep
oceans have ever dealt with the almost physical impossibility
of such a change having occurred without breaking
the continuity of terrestrial life, owing to the mean depth
of the ocean being at least six times the mean height of
the land, and its area nearly three times, so that the whole
mass of the land of the existing continents would be required
to build up even <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">one small</span> continent in the depths
of the Atlantic or Pacific! I have demonstrated this, with
a diagram, in my "Darwinism" (Chap, XII.), and it has
never been either refuted or noticed, but passed by as if it
did not exist! Your whole discussion of Dispersal and Distribution
is also admirable, and I was much interested with
your quotations from Guppy, whose book I have not seen,
but must read.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Most valuable to me also are your numerous references
to Darwin&#39;s letters, so that the article serves as a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span>

compendious index to the five volumes, as regards this

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Dr. Wallace,‚ÄîIt is difficult for me to tell you
how gratified I am by your extraordinarily kind letter....
The truth is that success was easy. It has been my
immense good fortune to know most of those who played

amanuensis to tell itself. But it is a real pleasure
to me to know that I have met with some measure of

<p class="tei tei-p">There are many essays in the book that you will not
like any more than I do. The secret of this lies in the
fact, which you pointed out in your memorable speech at
the Linnean Celebration, that no one but a naturalist can
really understand Darwin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I did not go to Cambridge‚ÄîI had my hands full here.
I was not sorry for the excuse. There seemed to me a
note of insincerity about the whole business. I am short-tempered.
I cannot stand being told that the origin of
species has still to be discovered, and that specific differences
have no "reality" (Bateson&#39;s Essay, p. 89). People
are of course at liberty to hold such opinions, but decency

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Wallace,‚Äî ... I have just got F. Darwin&#39;s
"Foundations." He tries to make out that his father
could have dispensed with Malthus. But the selection
death-rate in a slightly varying large population is <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">the</span>
pith of the whole business. The Darwin-Wallace theory
is, as you say, "the continuous adjustment of the organic

"a moving equilibrium." In fact, I have always maintained
that it is a mathematical conception.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Dr. Archdall Reid,‚ÄîMany thanks for your very
interesting and complimentary letter. I am very glad to
hear of your new book, which I doubt not will be very
interesting and instructive. The subjects you treat are,
however, so very complex, and require so much accurate
knowledge of the facts, and so much sound reasoning
upon them, that I cannot possibly undertake the labour
and thought required before I should feel justified in expressing
an opinion upon your treatment of them....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I rejoice to hear that you have exposed the fallacy of
the claims of the Mendelians. I have also tried to do so,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span>
<a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but I find it quite impossible for me to follow their detailed
studies and arguments. It wants a mathematical
mind, which I have not.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But on the general relation of Mendelism to Evolution
I have come to a very definite conclusion. This is, that it
has no relation whatever to the evolution of species or higher
groups, but is really antagonistic to such evolution! The
essential basis of evolution, involving as it does the most
minute and all-pervading adaptation to the whole environment,
is extreme and ever-present plasticity, as a
condition of survival and adaptation. But the essence of
Mendelian characters is their rigidity. They are transmitted
without variation, and therefore, except by the
rarest of accidents, can never become adapted to ever-varying
conditions. Moreover, when crossed they reproduce
the same pair of types in the same proportions as at first,
and therefore without selection; they are antagonistic to
evolution by continually reproducing injurious or useless
characters‚Äîwhich is the reason they are so rarely found in
nature, but are mostly artificial breeds or sports. My view
is, therefore, that Mendelian characters are of the nature
of abnormalities or monstrosities, and that the "Mendelian
laws" serve the purpose of eliminating them when, as
usually, they are not useful, and thus preventing them
from interfering with the normal process of natural selection
and adaptation of the more plastic races. I am also
glad to hear of your new argument for non-inheritance of
acquired characters.‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer,‚ÄîI thank you very much for
taking so much trouble as you have done in writing your
<span class="tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span>
<a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
views of my new book.<a name="noteref_39" id="noteref_39"></a><a href="#note_39"><span class="footnoteref">39</span></a> I am glad to find that you agree
with much of what I have said in the more evolutionary
part of it, and that you differ only on some of my suggested
interpretations of the facts. I have always felt the
disadvantage I have been under‚Äîmore especially during
the last twenty years‚Äîin having not a single good biologist
anywhere near me, with whom I could discuss matters
of theory or obtain information as to matters of fact. I am
therefore the more pleased that you do not seem to have come
across any serious misstatements in the botanical portions,
as to which I have had to trust entirely to second-hand
information, often obtained through a long and varied
correspondence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As to your disagreement from me in the conclusions
arrived at and strenuously advocated in the latter portions
of my work, I am not surprised. I am afraid, now,
that I have not expressed myself sufficiently clearly as to
the fundamental phenomena which seem to me absolutely
to necessitate a guiding mind and organising power.
Hardly one of my critics (I think absolutely not one) has
noticed the distinction I have tried and intended to draw
between Evolution on the one hand, and the fundamental
powers and properties of Life‚Äîgrowth, assimilation, reproduction,
heredity, etc.‚Äîon the other. In Evolution I
recognise the action of Natural Selection as universal and
capable of explaining all the facts of the continuous development
of species from species, "from am[oe]ba to man."
But this, as Darwin, Weismann, Kerner, Lloyd-Morgan,
and even Huxley have seen, has nothing whatever to do
with the basic mysteries of life‚Äîgrowth, etc. etc. The
chemists think they have done wonders when they have
produced in their laboratories certain organic substances‚Äîalways
by the use of other organic products‚Äîwhich life
<span class="tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span>
<a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
builds up within each organism, and from the few simple
elements available in air, earth, and water, innumerable
structures‚Äîbone, horn, hair, skin, blood, muscle, etc. etc.;
and these are not amorphous‚Äîmere lumps of dead matter‚Äîbut
organised to serve certain definite purposes in each
living organism. I have dwelt on this in my chapter on
"The Mystery of the Cell." Now I have been unable to
find any attempt by any biologist or physiologist to grapple
with this problem. One and all, they shirk it, or simply
state it to be insoluble. It is here that I state guidance
and organising power are essential. My little physiological
parable or allegory (p. 296) I think sets forth the difficulty
fairly, though by no means adequately, yet not one of about
fifty reviews I have read even mentions it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If you know of any writer of sufficient knowledge and
mental power, who has fully recognised and fairly grappled
with this fundamental problem, I should be very glad to be
referred to him. I have been able to find no approach to it.
Yet I am at once howled at, or sneered at, for pointing out
the facts that such problems exist, that they are not in any
way touched by Evolution, but are far before it, and the
forces, laws and agencies involved are those of existences
possessed of powers, mental and physical, far beyond those
mere mechanical, physical, or chemical forces we see at work
in nature....‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">The Ferns, Witcombe, Gloucester. February 12, 1911.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Wallace,‚Äî ... You must let me correct you
on one technical point in your letter. It is no longer possible
to say that chemists effect the synthesis of organic
products "by the use of other organic substances." From
what has been already effected, it cannot be doubted that
eventually every organic substance will be built up from
<span class="tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span>
<a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
"the few simple elements available in air, earth and
water." I think you may take it from me that this does
not admit of dispute....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At any rate we are in agreement as to Natural Selection
being capable of explaining evolution "from am[oe]ba
to man."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is generally admitted that that is a mechanical or
scientific explanation. That is to say, it invokes nothing
but intelligible actions and causes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">De Vries, however, asserts that the Darwinian theory is
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">not</span> scientific at all, and that is of course a position he has
a right to take up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But if we admit that it is scientific, then we are precluded
from admitting a "directive power."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This was von Baer&#39;s position, also that of Kant and of
Weismann.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But von Baer remarks that the naturalist is not precluded
from asking "whether the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">totality</span> of details leads him to a
general and final basis of intentional design." I have no
objection to this, and offer it as an olive-branch which you
can throw to your howling and sneering critics.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As to "structures organised to serve certain definite
purposes," surely they offer no more difficulty as regards
"scientific" explanation than the apparatus by which an
orchid is fertilised.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">We can work back to the am[oe]ba to find ourselves face
to face with a scarcely organised mass of protoplasm. And
then we find ourselves face to face with a problem which
will, perhaps, for ever remain insoluble scientifically.
But as for that, so is the primeval material of which
it (protoplasm) is composed. "Matter" itself is evaporating,
for it is being resolved by physical research into something
which is intangible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">We cannot form the slightest idea how protoplasm
<span class="tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span>
<a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
came into existence. It is impossible to regard it as a
mere substance. It is a mechanism. Although the chemist
may hope to make eventually all the substances which
protoplasm fabricates, and will probably do so, he can only
build them up by the most complicated processes. Protoplasm
appears to be able to manufacture them straight off
in a way of which the chemist cannot form the slightest
conception. This is one aspect of the mystery of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">life</span>.
Herbert Spencer&#39;s definition tells one nothing.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Science can only explain nature as it reveals itself to
the senses in terms of consciousness. The explanation may
be all wrong in the eyes of omniscience. All one can
say is that it is a practical working basis, and is good
enough for mundane purposes. But if I am asked if I
can solve the riddle of the Universe I can only answer,
No. Bruneti√®re then retorts that science is bankrupt.
But this is equivocal. It only means that it cannot meet
demands beyond its power to satisfy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I entirely sympathise with anyone who seeks an answer
from some other non-scientific source. But I keep scientific
explanations and spiritual craving wholly distinct.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The whole point of evolution, as formulated by Lyell
and Darwin, is to explain phenomena by known causes.
Now, directive power is not a known cause. Determinism
compels me to believe that every event is inevitable.
If we admit a directive power, the order of nature becomes
capricious and unintelligible. Excuse my saying all this.
But that is the dilemma as it presents itself to <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">my</span> mind.
If it does not trouble other people, I can only say, so much
the better for them. Briefly, I am afraid I must say that it
is ultra-scientific. I think that would have been pretty
much Darwin&#39;s view.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I do not think that it is quite fair to say that biologists
shirk the problem. In my opinion they are not called upon
<span class="tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span>
<a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to face it. Bastian, I suppose, believed that he had bridged
the gulf between lifeless and living matter. And here is a
man, of whom I know nothing, who has apparently got the
whole thing cut and dried.‚ÄîYours sincerely,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir,‚ÄîThanks for your kind congratulations, and
for the small pamphlet<a name="noteref_41" id="noteref_41"></a><a href="#note_41"><span class="footnoteref">41</span></a> you have sent me. I have read
it with much interest, as the writer was evidently a man
of thought and talent. The first lecture certainly gives
<span class="tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span>
<a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an approach to Darwin&#39;s theory, perhaps nearer than any
other, as he almost implies the "survival of the fittest"
as the cause of progressive modification. But his language
is imaginative and obscure. He uses "education" apparently
in the sense of what we should term "effect of the
environment."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The second lecture is even a more exact anticipation of
the modern views as to microbes, including their transmission
by flies and other insects and the probability that the
blood of healthy persons contains a sufficiency of destroyers
of the pathogenic germs‚Äîsuch as the white blood-corpuscles‚Äîto
preserve us in health.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But he is so anti-clerical and anti-Biblical that it is no
wonder he could not get a hearing in Boston in 1847.‚ÄîYours
very truly,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Poulton,‚ÄîAbout two months ago an American ... sent
me the enclosed booklet,<a name="noteref_42" id="noteref_42"></a><a href="#note_42"><span class="footnoteref">42</span></a> which he had been told
was very rare, and contained an anticipation of Darwinism.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This it certainly does, but the writer was highly imaginative,
and, like all the other anticipators of Darwin, did not
perceive the whole scope of his idea, being, as he himself
says, not sufficiently acquainted with the facts of nature.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His anticipations, however, of diverging lines of descent
from a common ancestor, and of the transmission of
disease germs by means of insects, are perfectly clear and
very striking.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As you yourself made known one of the anticipators of
Darwin, whom he himself had overlooked, you are the right
<span class="tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span>
<a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
person to make this known in any way you think proper.
As you have so recently been in America, you might perhaps
ascertain from the librarian of the public library in
Boston, or from some of your biological friends there, what
is known of the writer and of his subsequent history.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If the house at Down is ever dedicated to Darwin&#39;s
memory it would seem best to preserve this little book
there; if not you can dispose of it as you think best.‚ÄîYours

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Poulton,‚ÄîI am very glad you have changed your
view about the "Sleeper" lectures being a "fake." The
writer was too earnest, and too clear a thinker, to descend
to any such trick. And for what? "Agnostic" is not in
Shakespeare, but it may well have been used by someone
before Huxley. The parts of your Address of which you

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir,‚Äî ... I presume your question "Why?"
as to the varying colour of individual hairs and feathers,
and the regular varying of adjacent hairs, etc., to form
the surface pattern, applies to the ultimate cause which
enables those patterns to be hereditary, and, in the case
of birds, to be reproduced after moulting yearly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The purpose, or end they serve, I have, I think, sufficiently
dealt with in my "Darwinism"; the method by
which such useful tints and markings are produced, because
useful, is, I think, clearly explained by the law of Natural
Selection or Survival of the Fittest, acting through the universal
facts of heredity and variation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the "why"‚Äîwhich goes further back, to the directing
agency which not only brings each special cell of the
highly complex structure of a feather into its exactly right
position, but, further, carries pigments or produces surface
stri√¶ (in the case of the metallic or interference colours)
also to their exactly right place, and nowhere else‚Äîis the
mystery, which, if we knew, we should (as Tennyson said
of the flower in the wall) "know what God and Man is."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The idea that "cells" are all conscious beings and go
to their right places has been put forward by Butler in his
<span class="tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span>
<a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
wonderful book "Life and Habit," and now even Haeckel
seems to adopt it. All theories of heredity, including Darwin&#39;s
pangenesis, do not touch it, and it seems to me as
fundamental as life and consciousness, and to be absolutely
inconceivable by us till we know what life is, what spirit
is, and what matter is; and it is probable that we must
develop in the spirit world some few thousand million years
before we get to this knowledge‚Äîif then!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My book, "Man&#39;s Place in the Universe," shows, I think,
indications of the vast importance of that Universe as the
producer of Man which so many scientific men to-day try to
belittle, because of what may be, in the infinite!‚ÄîYours very
truly,</p>

<h2 class="tei tei-head">Home Life</h2>

<p class="tei tei-p">(By W.G. WALLACE and VIOLET WALLACE)</p>


<p class="tei tei-p">In our father&#39;s youth and prime he was 6 ft. 1 in. in
height, with square though not very broad shoulders.
At the time to which our first clear recollections go
back he had already acquired a slight stoop due to long
hours spent at his desk, and this became more pronounced
with advancing age; but he was always tall, spare and very
active, and walked with a long easy swinging stride
which he retained to the end of his life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As a boy he does not appear to have been very athletic
or muscularly strong, and his shortsightedness probably
prevented him from taking part in many of the pastimes
of his schoolfellows. He was never a good swimmer, and
he used to say that his long legs pulled him down. He
was, however, always a good walker and, until quite late
in life, capable of taking long country walks, of which he
was very fond.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was very quick and active in his movements at times,
and even when 90 years of age would get up on a chair or
sofa to reach a book from a high shelf, and move about his
study with rapid strides to find some paper to which he
wished to refer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When out of doors he usually carried an umbrella, and
in the garden a stick, upon which he leaned rather heavily
in his later years. His hair became white rather early in
life, but it remained thick and fine to the last, a fact which
he attributed to always wearing soft hats. He had full
<span class="tei-pb" id="page104">[pg 104]</span>
<a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
beard and whiskers, which were also white. His eyes were
blue and his complexion rather pale. He habitually wore
spectacles, and to us he never looked quite natural without
them. Towards the end of his life his eyes were subject
to inflammation, and the glasses were blue. His hands,
though large, were not clumsy, and were capable of very
delicate manipulation, as is shown by his skill in handling
and preserving insects and bird-skins, and also in sketching,
where delicacy of touch was essential. His handwriting
is another example of this; it remained clear and
even to the end, in spite of the fact that he wrote all his
books, articles, and letters with his own hand until the
last few years, when he occasionally had assistance with
his correspondence; but his last two books, "Social Environment"
and "The Revolt of Democracy," written
when he was 90 years of age, were penned by himself, and
the MSS. are perfectly legible and regular.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was very domestic, and loved his home. His interest
extended to the culinary art, and he was fond of telling
us how certain things should be cooked. This became
quite a joke among us. He was very independent, and it
never seemed to occur to him to ask to have anything done
for him if he could do it himself‚Äîand he could do many
things, such as sewing on buttons and tapes and packing
up parcels, with great neatness. When unpacking parcels
he never cut the string if it could be untied, and he would
fold it up before removing the paper, which in its turn was
also neatly folded.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His clothes were always loose and easy-fitting, and
generally of some quiet-coloured cloth or tweed. Out of
doors he wore a soft black felt hat rather taller than the
clerical pattern, and a black overcoat unless the weather
was very warm. He wore no ornaments of any kind, and
even the silver watch-chain was worn so as to be invisible.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span>
<a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He wore low collars with turned-down points and
a narrow black tie, which was, however, concealed by his
beard. He was not very particular about his personal
appearance, except that he always kept his hair and beard
well brushed and trimmed.</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">MRS. A.R. WALLACE (about 1895)</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In our early days at Grays we children were allowed to
run in and out of his study; but if he was busy writing at
the moment we would look at a book until he could give us
his attention. His brother in California sent him a live
specimen of the lizard called the "horned toad," and this
creature was kept in the study, where it was allowed to
roam about, its favourite place being on the hearth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">About this time he read "Alice through the Looking-glass,"
which pleased him greatly; he was never tired of
quoting from it and using some of Lewis Carroll&#39;s quaint
words till it became one of our classics.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Some of our earliest recollections are of the long and
interesting walks we took with our father and mother. He
never failed to point out anything of interest and tell us
what he knew about it, and would answer our numerous
questions if possible, or put us off with some joking reference
to Boojums or Jabberwocks. We looked upon him as
an infallible source of information, not only in our childhood,
but to a large extent all his life. When exploring
the country he scorned "trespass boards." He read them
"Trespassers will be persecuted," and then ignored them,
much to our childish trepidation. If he was met by indignant
gamekeepers or owners, they were often too much
awed by his dignified and commanding appearance to offer
any objection to his going where he wished. He was fond
of calling our attention to insects and to other objects of
natural history, and giving us interesting lessons about
them. He delighted in natural scenery, especially distant
views, and our walks and excursions were generally taken
<span class="tei-pb" id="page106">[pg 106]</span>
<a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with some object, such as finding a bee-orchis or a rare
plant, or exploring a new part of the country, or finding
a waterfall.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1876 we went to live at Dorking, but stayed there
only a year or two. An instance of his love of mystifying
us children may be given. It must have been shortly after
our arrival at Dorking that one day, having been out to
explore the neighbourhood, he returned about tea-time and
said, "Where do you think I have been? To Glory!"
Of course we were very properly excited, and plied him
with questions, but we got nothing more out of him then.
Later on we were taken to see the wonderful place called
"Glory Wood"; and it had surely gained in glory by such
preparation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sometimes it would happen that a scene or object
would recall an incident in his tropical wanderings and
he would tell us of the sights he had seen. At the time
he was greatly interested in botany, in which he was
encouraged by our mother, who was an ardent lover of
flowers; and to the end of his life he exhibited almost
boyish delight when he discovered a rare plant. Many
walks and excursions were taken for the purpose of seeing
some uncommon plant growing in its natural habitat.
When he had found the object of his search we were all
called to see it. During his walks and holidays he made
constant use of the one-inch Ordnance Maps, which he
obtained for each district he visited, planning out our excursions
on the map before starting. He had a gift for
finding the most beautiful walks by means of it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1878 we moved to Croydon, where we lived about four
years. It was at this time that he hoped to get the post of
Superintendent of Epping Forest. We still remember all
the delights we children were promised if we went to live
there. We had a day&#39;s excursion to see the Forest, he with
<span class="tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span>
<a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his map finding out the roads and stopping every now and
then to admire a fresh view or to explain what he would do
if the opportunity were given him. It was a very hot day,
and we became so thirsty that when we reached a stream,
to our great joy and delight he took out of his pocket, not
the old leather drinking-cup he usually carried, but a long
piece of black indiarubber tubing. We can see him now,
quite as pleased as we were with this brilliant idea, letting
it down into the stream and then offering us a drink! No
water ever tasted so nice! Our mother used to be a little
anxious as to the quality of the water, but he always put
aside such objections by saying <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">running</span> water was quite
safe, and somehow we never came to any harm through it.
The same happy luck attended our cuts and scratches; he
always put "stamp-paper" on them, calling it plaster,
and we knew of no other till years later. He used the
same thing for his own cuts, etc., to the end of his life,
with no ill effects.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1881 we moved again, this time to Godalming, where
he had built a small house which be called "Nutwood Cottage."
After Croydon this was a very welcome change and
we all enjoyed the lovely country round. The garden as
usual was the chief hobby, and Mr. J.W. Sharpe, our old
friend and neighbour in those days, has written his reminiscences
of this time which give a very good picture of
our father. They are as follows:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">About thirty-five years ago Dr. Wallace built a house
upon a plot of ground adjoining that upon which our house
stood. I was at that time an assistant master at Charterhouse
School; and Dr. Wallace became acquainted with a
few of the masters besides myself. With two or three of
them he had regular weekly games of chess; for he was
then and for long afterwards very fond of that game;
and, I understand, possessed considerable skill at it. A
<span class="tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span>
<a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
considerable portion of his spare time was spent in his
garden, in the management of which Mrs. Wallace, who
had much knowledge and experience of gardening, very
cordially assisted him. Here his characteristic energy and
restlessness were conspicuously displayed. He was always
designing some new feature, some alteration in a flower-bed,
some special environment for a new plant; and always
he was confident that the new schemes would be found to
have all the perfections which the old ones lacked. From
all parts of the world botanists and collectors sent him,
from time to time, rare or newly discovered plants, bulbs,
roots or seeds, which he, with the help of Mrs. Wallace&#39;s
practical skill, would try to acclimatise, and to persuade
to grow somewhere or other in his garden or conservatory.
Nothing disturbed his cheerful confidence in the future, and
nothing made him happier than some plan for reforming the
house, the garden, the kitchen-boiler, or the universe. And,
truth to say, he displayed great ingenuity in all these enterprises
of reformation. Although they were never in effect
what they were expected to be by their ingenious author,
they were often sufficiently successful; but, successful or
not, he was always confident that the next would turn out
to be all that he expected of it. With the same confidence
he made up his mind upon many a disputable subject; but,
be it said, never without a laborious examination of the
necessary data, and the acquisition of much knowledge. In
argument, of which intellectual exercise he was very fond,
he was a formidable antagonist. His power of handling
masses of details and facts, of showing their inner meanings
and the principles underlying them, and of making
them intelligible, was very great; and very few men of
his time had it in equal measure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But the most striking feature in his conversation was
his masterly application of general principles: these he
handled with extraordinary skill. In any subject with
which he was familiar, he would solve, or suggest a plausible
solution of, difficulty after difficulty by immediate reference
to fundamental principles. This would give to his
conclusions an appearance of inevitableness which usually
<span class="tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span>
<a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
overbore his adversary, and, even if it did not convince
him, left him without any effective reply. This, too, had a
good deal to do, I am disposed to conjecture, with another
very noticeable characteristic of his which often came out
in conversation, and that was his apparently unfailing
confidence in the goodness of human nature. No man nor
woman but he took to be in the main honest and truthful,
and no amount of disappointment‚Äînot even losses of money
and property incurred through this faith in others&#39; virtues‚Äîhad
the effect of altering this mental habit of his.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His intellectual interests were very widely extended,
and he once confessed to me that they were agreeably
stimulated by novelty and opposition. An uphill fight in
an unpopular cause, for preference a thoroughly unpopular
one, or any argument in favour of a generally despised
thesis, had charms for him that he could not resist. In
his later years, especially, the prospect of writing a new
book, great or small, upon any one of his favourite subjects
always acted upon him like a tonic, as much so as
did the project of building a new house and laying out a
new garden. And in all this his sunny optimism and his
unfailing confidence in his own powers went far towards
securing him success.‚ÄîJ.W.S.</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="tei tei-p">"Land Nationalisation" (1882), "Bad Times" (1885),
and "Darwinism" (1889) were written at Godalming, also
the series of lectures which he gave in America in 1886-7
and at various towns in the British Isles. He also continued
to have examination papers<a name="noteref_44" id="noteref_44"></a><a href="#note_44"><span class="footnoteref">44</span></a> to correct each year‚Äîand a very
strenuous time that was. Our mother used to assist him in
this work, and also with the indexes of his books.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">We now began to make nature collections, in which he
took the keenest interest, many holidays and excursions
being arranged to further these engrossing pursuits. One
or two incidents occurred at "Nutwood" which have left
clear impressions upon our minds. One day one of us
<span class="tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span>
<a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
brought home a beetle, to the great horror of the servant.
Passing at the moment, he picked it up, saying, "Why, it
is quite a harmless little creature!" and to demonstrate its
inoffensiveness he placed it on the tip of his nose, whereupon
it immediately bit him and even drew blood, much to
our amusment and his own astonishment. On another
occasion he was sitting with a book on the lawn under
the oak tree when suddenly a large creature alighted
upon his shoulder. Looking round, he saw a fine specimen
of the ring-tailed lemur, of whose existence in the
neighbourhood he had no knowledge, though it belonged
to some neighbours about a quarter of a mile away. It
seemed appropriate that the animal should have selected
for its attentions the one person in the district who would
not be alarmed at the sudden appearance of a strange
animal upon his shoulder. Needless to say, it was quite
friendly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A year or so before we left Godalming he enlarged the
house and altered the garden. But his health not having
been very good, causing him a good deal of trouble with
his eyes, and having more or less exhausted the possibilities
of the garden, he decided to leave Godalming and find
a new house in a milder climate. So in 1889 he finally fixed
upon a small house at Parkstone in Dorset.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Planning and constructing houses, gardens, walls, paths,
rockeries, etc., were great hobbies of his, and he often spent
hours making scale drawings of some new house or of alterations
to an existing one, and scheming out the details of construction.
At other times he would devise schemes for new
rockeries or waterworks, and he would always talk them over
with us and tell us of some splendid new idea he had hit upon.
As Mr. Sharpe has noted, he was always very optimistic, and
if a scheme did not come up to his expectations he was not
discouraged but always declared he could do it much better
<span class="tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span>
<a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
next time and overcome the defects. He was generally in
better health and happier when some constructional work
was in hand. He built three houses, "The Dell" at Grays,
"Nutwood Cottage" at Godalming, and the "Old Orchard"
at Broadstone. The last he actually built himself, employing
the men and buying all the materials, with the assistance
of a young clerk of works; but though the enterprise was a
source of great pleasure, it was a constant worry. He also
designed and built a concrete garden wall, with which he
was very pleased, though it cost considerably more than he
anticipated. He had not been at Parkstone long before
he set about the planning of "alterations" with his usual
enthusiasm. We were both away from home at this time, and
consequently had many letters from him, of which one
is given as a specimen. His various interests are nearly
always referred to in these letters, and in not a few
of them his high spirits show themselves in bursts of
exuberance which were very characteristic whenever a new
scheme was afoot. The springs of eternal youth were for ever
bubbling up afresh, so that to us he never grew old. One of

said, "What a wonderful old man your father is!" This
was quite a shock, for to us he was not old. The letter referred

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Will,‚ÄîAnother week has passed away into
eternity, another month has opened its eyes on the world,
and still the illustrious Charles [bricklayer] potters about,
still the carpenter plies the creaking saw and the stunning
hammer, still the plumber plumbs and the bellhanger rattles,
still the cisterns overflow and the unfinished drains send
forth odorous fumes, still the rains descend and all around
<span class="tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span>

the house is a muddle of muck and mire, and still there is so
much to do that we look forward to some far distant futurity,
when all that we are now suffering will be over, and we may
look back upon it as upon some strange yet not altogether
uninteresting nightmare!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Briefly to report progress. The new pipe-man has finished
the bathroom and nearly done the bells, and we have had gas
alight the last three days. The balcony is finished, the bath
and lavatory are closed up and waiting for the varnishers.
Charles has finished the roof, and the scaffolding is removed.
But though two plumbers have tried all their skill, the ball-cock
in the cistern won&#39;t work, and when the water has been
turned on an hour it overflows. The gutters and pipes to roof
are not up, and the night before last a heavy flood of rain
washed a quantity of muddy water into the back entrance,
which flowed right across the kitchen into the back passage
and larder, leaving a deposit of alluvial mud that would have
charmed a geologist. However, we have stopped that for the
future by a drain under the doorstep. The new breakfast-room
is being papered and will look tidy soon. A man has
been to measure for the stairs. The front porch door is
promised for to-morrow, and the stairs, I suppose, in another
week. A lot of fresh pointing is to be done, and all the rain-water
pipes and the rain-water cistern with its overflow pipes,
and then the greenhouse, and then all the outside painting‚Äîafter
which we shall rest for a month and then do the inside
papering; but whether that can be done before Easter seems
very doubtful....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Our alterations still go on. The stairs just up‚ÄîFriday
night we had to go outside to get to bed, and Saturday and
Sunday we <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">could</span> get up, but over a chasm, and with alarming
creaks. Now it is all firm, but no handrail yet. Painters
still at work, and whitewashers. Porch door up, with two

on both sides of the Furka Pass yesterday, and about here
to-day. The Furka Pass on both sides is a perfect flower-garden,
and the two sides have mostly different species.
The violets and anemones were lovely, and I have got two
species of glorious gentians.... All the flowers in the box
are very choice species, and have been carefully dug up, and
having seen how they grow, I have been thinking of a plan
of making a little bed for them on the top of the new rockery
where there is now nothing particular. Will you please plant
them out carefully in the zinc tray of peat and sphagnum that
stands outside near the little greenhouse door? Just lift up
the sphagnum and see if the earth beneath is moist, if not
give it a soaking. Then put them all in, the short-rooted
ones in the sphagnum only, the others through into the peat.
Then give them a good syringing and put the tray under
the shelf outside the greenhouse, and cover with newspaper
for a day or two. After that I think they will do, keeping
them moist if the weather is dry. I am getting hosts of
curiosities. To-day we found four or five species of willows
from 1/4 in. to 2 in. high, and other rarities.... In haste
for post and dinner.‚ÄîYour ever affectionate</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Violet,‚ÄîIn your previous letter you asked me
the conundrum, Why does a wagtail wag its tail? That&#39;s
quite easy, on Darwinian principles. Many birds wag their
tails. Some Eastern flycatchers‚Äîalso black and white‚Äîwag
<span class="tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span>
<a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their long tails up and down when they alight on the ground
or on a branch. Other birds with long tails jerk them up in
the air when they alight on a branch. Now these varied
motions, like the motions of many butterflies, caterpillars,
and many other animals, must have a use to the animal, and
the most common, or rather the most probable, use is, either
to frighten or to distract an enemy. If a hawk was very
hungry and darted down on a wagtail from up in the air,
the wagging tail would be seen most distinctly and be aimed
at, and thus the bird would be missed or at most a feather
torn out of the tail. The bird hunts for food in the open,
on the edges of ponds and streams, and would be especially
easy to capture, hence the wagging tail has been developed
to baffle the enemy....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Violet,‚Äî ... I have now finished reading the

twice, and it will bear reading many times. It corresponds
pretty nearly in date with the "Iliad," the scenes it describes
being supposed to be about B.C. 1500. Many of the
ideas and moral teachings are beautiful; equal to the best
teaching and superior to the general practice of to-day. I
have made a lot of emendations and suggestions, which I
am going to send to the translator, as the proofs have evidently
not been carefully read by any English literary man.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">About the year 1899 Dr. Wallace began to think of leaving
Parkstone, partly for reasons of health and partly to get

were all pressed to join in the search. Finally he found just
the spot he wanted at Broadstone; only three miles away.

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Will,‚ÄîAt length the long quest has come to
an end, and I have agreed to buy three acres of land at
Broadstone. Ma and I have just been over again this morning
to consider its capabilities, and the exact boundaries
that will be the most advantageous, as I have here the great
advantage of choosing exactly what I will have. I only
wish I could afford five acres instead of three, or even ten;
but the three will contain the very eye of the whole. I
enclose you a bit of the 6-inch ordnance on which I have
marked the piece I have finally fixed upon in red chalk.
The attractive bit is the small enclosure of one acre, left
rather paler, which is an old orchard in a little valley
sloping downward to the S.S.E. There are, perhaps, a
score of trees in it‚Äîapples, pears, plums and cherries, I
believe, and under them a beautiful green short turf like
a lawn‚Äîkept so, I believe, by rabbits. From the top of
this orchard is a fine view over moor and heather, then
over the great northern bay of Poole Harbour, and beyond
to the Purbeck Hills and out to the sea and the Old Harry
headland. It is not very high‚Äîabout 140 feet, I think, but
being on the edge of one of the plateaus the view is very
effective. On the top to the left of the road track is a
slightly undulating grass field, of which I have a little less
than an acre. To the right of the fence, and coming down
to the wood, is very rough ground densely covered with
heather and dwarf gorse, a great contrast to the field. The
wood on the right is mixed but chiefly oak, I think, with
some large firs, one quite grand; while the wood on the left
is quite different, having some very tall Spanish chestnuts
<span class="tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span>
<a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
loaded with fruit, some beeches, some firs‚Äîbut I have not
had time yet to investigate thoroughly. Thus this little bit
of three acres has five subdivisions, each with a quite distinct
character of its own, and I never remember seeing such
variety in such a small area. The red wavy line is about
where I shall have to make my road, for the place has
now no road, and I think I am very lucky in discovering
it and in getting it. Another advantage is in the land,
which is varied to suit all crops. I fancy ... I shall find
places to grow most of my choice shrubs, etc., better than
here. I expect bulbs of all kinds will grow well, and I
mean to plant a thousand or so of snowdrops, crocuses,
squills, daffodils, etc., in the orchard, where they will look
lovely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Will,‚Äî ... I have taken advantage of a foggy
cold day to trace you a copy of the ground plan of the proposed
house.... Of course the house will be much larger
than we want, but I look to future value, and rather than
build it smaller, to be enlarged afterwards, I would prefer
to leave the drawing-room and bedroom adjoining with bare
walls inside till they can be properly finished. The house-keeper&#39;s
room would be a nice dining-room, and the hall
a parlour and drawing-room combined. But the outside
must be finished, on account of the garden, creepers, etc.
The S.E. side (really about S.S.E.) has the fine views. If
you can arrange to come at Christmas we will have a picnic
on the ground the first sunny day. I was all last week
surveying‚Äîa very difficult job, to mark out exactly three
acres so as to take in exactly as much of each kind of
ground as I wanted, and with no uninterrupted view over
any one of the boundary lines! I found the sextant, and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page119">[pg 119]</span>
<a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it was very useful setting out the two right angles of the
northern boundary. I have not got possession yet, but
hope to do so by next week. The house, we reckon, can
be built for ¬£1,000 at the outside....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mrs. Fisher,‚Äî ... You will be surprised to hear
that I have been so rash as to buy land and to (propose
to) build a house! Every other effort to get a pleasant
country cottage with a little land having failed, we discovered,
accidentally, a charming spot only four miles from
this house and half a mile from Broadstone Station, and
have succeeded in buying three acres, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">chosen by myself</span>,
from Lord Wimborne at what is really a reasonable price.
In its contour, views, wood, and general aspect of wild
nature it is almost perfection; and Annie, Violet, and Will
are all pleased and satisfied with it. It is on the slope of
the Broadstone middle plateau, looking south over Poole
Harbour with the Purbeck Hills beyond, and a little eastward
out to the sea.... The ground is good loam in the
orchard, with some sand and clay in the field, but this is
so open to the sun and air that we are not afraid of it, as
the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">house-site</span> will be entirely concreted over, and I have
arranged for a heating stove in a cellar, which will warm
and dry the whole basement. In a week or two we hope
to begin building, so you may fancy how busy I am,
especially as we are building it without a contractor, with
the help of a friend.... I go over two or three times a
week, as I have two gardeners at work. In the summer
(should I be still in the land of the living) I hope you will
be able to come and see our little estate, which is to be
called by the descriptive name of "Old Orchard." I have

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Will,‚ÄîThis week&#39;s progress has been fairly good
although the wet after the frost has caused two falls in the
cellar excavations, and we have had to put drain pipes to
carry water out, though not much accumulated.... During
the week some horses in the field have not only eaten off the
tops of the privet hedge, but have torn up some dozens of
the plants by the roots, by putting their heads over the 4-foot
wire fence. I am therefore obliged in self-defence to raise
the post a foot higher and put barbed wire along the top of
it. Some cows also got in our ground one day and ate off
the tops of the newly planted laurels, which I am told they
are very fond of, so I have got a chain and padlock for our
gate....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">We moved into the new house at Broadstone at the end

Dr. Wallace lived till the end of his life. The garden was
an endless source of interest and occupation, being much
larger than any he had had since leaving Grays.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When writing he was not easily disturbed and never
showed any impatience or annoyance at any interruption.
If interrupted by a question he would pause, pen in hand,
and reply or discuss the matter and then resume his unfinished
sentence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He seemed to have the substance of his writing in his
mind before he commenced, and did not often refer to books
or to notes, though he usually had one or two books or papers
on the table at hand, and sometimes he would jump up to get
a book from the shelves to verify some fact or figure. When
preparing for a new book or article he read a great many
works and papers bearing on the subject. These were marked
<span class="tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span>
<a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
with notes and references on the flyleaves; and often by pencil
marks to indicate important passages, but he did not often
make separate notes. He had a wonderful memory, and
stored in his mind the facts and arguments he wished to use,
or the places where they were to be found. He borrowed
many books from libraries, and from these he sometimes
made a few notes. He was not a sound sleeper, and frequently
lay awake during the night, and then it was that
he thought out and planned his work. He often told us
with keen delight of some new idea or fresh argument which
had occurred to him during these waking hours.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After spending months, or sometimes years, in reading
and digesting all the literary matter he could obtain on a
subject,‚Äîand forming a plan for the treatment of it, he
would commence writing, and keep on steadily for five or
six hours a day if his health permitted. He also wrote to
people all over the world to obtain the latest facts bearing
on the subject.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1903 he began writing "Man&#39;s Place in the Universe."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Will,‚ÄîI have just finished going over your notes
and corrections of the last four chapters. I can&#39;t think how
I was so stupid to make the mistake in figures which you
corrected. In almost all cases I have made some modification
in accordance with your suggestions, and the book will
be much improved thereby. I have put in a new paragraph
about the stars in other parts than the Milky Way and Solar
Cluster, but there is really nothing known about them. I
have also cut out the first reference to Jupiter altogether.
Of course a great deal is speculative, but any reply to it is
equally speculative. The question is, which speculation is
most in accordance with the known facts, and not with prepossessions
only?</p>

<span class="tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span>

written in less than three months, it cannot be expected to
be as complete and careful as if three years had been expended
on it, but then it is fresher perhaps. The bit about
the pure air came to me while writing, and I let myself go.
Why should I not try and do a little good and make people
think a little on such matters, when I have the chance of
perhaps more readers than all my other books?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As to my making too much of Man, of course that is the
whole subject of the book! And I look at it differently from
you, because I know <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">facts</span> about him you neither know nor

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Will,‚Äî ... After elaborate revision and correction
I have sent my MS. of the little "Mars" book to Macmillans
yesterday.... Will you read the whole proofs carefully,
in the character of the "intelligent reader"? Your
fresh eye will detect little slips, bad logic, too positive statements,
etc., which I may have overlooked. It will only be
about 100 or 150 pages large type‚Äîand I want it to be really
good, and free from blunders that any fool can see....</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">For some years now he had suffered from repeated attacks
of asthma and bronchitis. He had tried the usual remedies
for these complaints without any good results, and, though
still able to write, had then no thought of beginning any large
work; in fact, he considered he had but a few more years to
live. When Mr. Bruce-Joy came to see him in order to model
the portrait medallion, he mentioned in the course of conversation
that he had tried the Salisbury treatment with
wonderful results. Our father was at first incredulous, but
<span class="tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span>
<a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
decided to try it in a modified form. He gave up all starchy
foods and ate beef only, cooked in a special manner to render
it more digestible. He found such relief from this change of
diet that from this time onwards he followed a very strict
daily routine, which he continued to the end of his life with
slight variations.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He made himself a cup of tea on a gas stove in his bedroom
at 6 a.m. (the exact quantity of tea and water having
been measured the previous evening), and boiled it in a small
double saucepan for a definite time by the watch. He always
said this cup of tea tasted better than at any other time of
the day. He then returned to bed and slept till 8 a.m.
During his last two or three years he suffered from rheumatism
in his shoulder and it took him a long time to dress, and
he called in the aid of his gardener in the last year, who acted
as his valet. While dressing he prepared a cup of cocoa on
the gas stove, which he carried into the study (next door) at
9 a.m. This was all he had for breakfast, and he took it
while reading the paper or his letters.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dinner at one o&#39;clock was taken with his family, and he
usually related any interesting or striking news he had read
in the paper, or in his correspondence, and commented upon
it, or perhaps he would tell us of some new flower in the
garden.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He drank hot water with a little Canary sack and a dash
of soda-water, to which he added a spoonful of plum jam.
He was very fond of sweet things, such as puddings, but he
had to partake sparingly of them, and it was a great temptation
when some dish of which he was particularly fond was
placed upon the table.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After dinner he usually took a nap in the study before
resuming work or going into the garden.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Tea was at four o&#39;clock, and consisted only of a cup of tea,
which he made himself in the study, unless there were visitors
whom he wished to see, when he would sometimes take it
into the drawing-room and make it there.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After tea he again wrote, or took a turn in the garden if
the weather and season permitted. Latterly he spent a good
part of the afternoon and evening reading and dozing on the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span>
<a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sofa, and only worked at short intervals when he felt equal
to it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Supper, at seven, was a repetition of dinner, and he took
it with us in the dining-room. After supper he generally
read a novel before the fire except in the very hottest weather,
and he frequently dozed on and off till he retired at eleven.
He made himself a cup of cocoa while preparing for bed, and
drank it just before lying down.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">For the last year or two it was a constant difficulty with
him to secure enough nourishment without aggravating his
ailments by indigestion. During this time he suffered continuous
discomfort, though he seldom gave utterance to
complaint or allowed it to affect the uniform equability of his
temper.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">In 1903 his daughter came to live with her parents, who
generously allowed her to take three or four children as
pupils. At first we feared they might bother our father, but
he really enjoyed seeing them about and talking to them.
He was always interested in any new child, and if for a
short time none were forthcoming, always lamented the fact.
At dinner the children would ask him all sorts of questions,
very amusing ones sometimes. They were also intensely interested
in what he ate, and watched with speechless wonder
when they saw him eating orange, banana, and sugar with
his meat.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One of these early pupils, Reginald B. Rathbone, has
sent reminiscences which are so characteristic that we give
them as they stand:</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">"I have stayed at Dr. Wallace&#39;s house on three occasions;
the first two were when I was only about eight or nine years
old, and my recollections of him at that time are therefore
necessarily somewhat dim. Certain things, however, have
stuck in my memory. I went there quite prepared to see a
very venerable and imposing-looking old gentleman, and
filled in advance with much awe and respect for him. As
regards his personal appearance I was by no mean disappointed,
as his tall, slightly-stooping figure, long white
<span class="tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span>
<a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
hair and beard, and his spectacles fulfilled my highest expectations,
I remember being struck with the kindly look
of his eyes, and indeed they did not belie his nature, for he
always treated me with great kindness, patience and indulgence,
which is somewhat remarkable considering my age,
and how exasperating I must have been sometimes. I soon
began to regard him as a never-failing fount of wisdom,
and as one who could answer any question one liked to
put to him. Of this latter fact I was not slow to take
advantage. I plied him with every kind of question my
imaginative young brain could conceive, usually beginning
with &#39;why.&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He nearly always gave me an answer, and what is more,
a satisfactory one, and well within the scope of my limited
understanding. These definite, satisfactory answers of his
used to afford me great pleasure, it being quite a new experience
for me to have all my questions answered for me in
this way. These answers, as I have said, were nearly always
forthcoming, though indeed, on one or two occasions, in
answer to an especially ridiculous query of mine he would
answer, &#39;That is a very foolish question, Reggie.&#39; But this
was very rare.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I remember taking a great interest in what Dr. Wallace
ate. He had a hearty appetite, and was no believer in vegetarianism,
for at lunch his diet consisted chiefly of cold beef,
liberally seasoned with various sauces and relishes, also
vinegar. I used to gaze at these bottles with great admiration.
Whenever there were peas he used to take large
quantities of sugar with them. This greatly aroused my
curiosity, and I questioned him about it. &#39;Why,&#39; said he,
&#39;peas themselves contain sugar; it is, therefore, much more
sensible to take sugar with them than salt.&#39; And he recounted
an anecdote of how an eminent personage he had
once dined with had been waited on with great respect and
attention by all present, but salt was offered to him with the
peas. &#39;If you want to make me quite happy,&#39; said the great
man, &#39;you will give me some sugar with my peas.&#39; His
favourite drink, I remember, was Canary sack.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"He had a strongly humorous side, and always enjoyed a
<span class="tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span>
<a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
good laugh. As an instance of this, I will recount the
following incident: When I had returned home after my first
visit to &#39;The Old Orchard,&#39; my sister, three years older
than myself, and I had a heated argument on the subject of
the number of stomachs in a cow. I insisted it was three;
she, on the other hand, held that it was seven. After a long
and fierce dispute, I exclaimed: &#39;Well, let us write to
Dr. Wallace, and he will settle it for us and tell us the real
number.&#39; This we did, the brazen audacity of the proceeding
not striking us at the time. By return of post we received a
letter which, alas! I have unfortunately not preserved, but
the substance of which I well remember. &#39;Dear Irene and
Reggie,&#39; it ran, &#39;Your dispute as to the number of stomachs
which a cow possesses can be settled and rectified by a simple
mathematical process usually called subtraction, thus:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p"></p><table cellspacing="0" class="tei tei-table"><colgroup span="2"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="tei tei-row"><td class="tei tei-cell">Irene&#39;s Cow </td><td class="tei tei-cell"> 7 stomachs</td></tr><tr class="tei tei-row"><td class="tei tei-cell">Reggie&#39;s Cow </td><td class="tei tei-cell">3 stomachs</td></tr><tr class="tei tei-row"><td class="tei tei-cell"> The Farmer&#39;s cow</td><td class="tei tei-cell">4 stomachs</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Dr. Wallace then went on to explain the names and uses
of the four stomachs.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Two instances of his fun come to my mind as I write.
&#39;Why,&#39; I asked, &#39;do you sometimes take off your spectacles
to read the paper?&#39; &#39;Because I can see better without
&#39;em,&#39; he said. &#39;Then why,&#39; I asked again, &#39;do you ever
wear them?&#39; &#39;Because I can see better with &#39;em,&#39; was the
reply. The other instance relates to chloroform. He was
describing the agonies suffered by those who had to undergo
amputation before the discovery of an√¶sthetics, whereas
nowadays, he said, &#39;you are put under chloroform, then
wake up and find your arm cut off, having felt nothing. Or
you wake up and find your leg cut off. Or you wake up and
find your head cut off!&#39; He then laughed heartily at his
own joke.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"These are just a few miscellaneous reminiscences, many
of them no doubt trivial, but they may perhaps be not entirely
devoid of interest, when it is remembered that they are the

<p class="tei tei-p">The year 1908 was very auspicious to Dr. Wallace. To
begin with, it was the fiftieth anniversary of the reading of
the Darwin and Wallace joint papers on the Origin of
Species before the Linnean Society, an event which was commemorated
in the way described elsewhere.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the autumn, and just as he was beginning to recover
from a spell of bad health, he was invited to give a lecture
at the Royal Institution, the prospect of which seemed to
have upon him a most stimulating effect; he at once began to
think about a suitable subject.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Following closely on this came the news that the Order of
Merit was to be conferred upon him. His letters to his son

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Will,‚Äî ... I have a rather surprising bit of
news for you. When I was almost at my worst, feeling very
bad, I had a letter inviting me to give an evening lecture at
the Royal Institution, for their Jubilee of the "Origin of
Species"! Of course I decided at once to decline as impossible,
etc., having nothing new to say, etc. But a few
hours afterwards an idea suddenly came to me for a very
fine lecture, if I can work it out as I hope‚Äîand the more
I thought over it the better it seemed. So, two days back,
I wrote to Sir W. Crookes‚Äîthe Honorary Secretary, who
had written to me‚Äîaccepting provisionally!... Here is
another "crowning honour"‚Äîthe most unexpected of

I am duly "invested," and have got two engrossed documents,
both signed by the King, one appointing me a member
of the "Order of Merit" with all sorts of official and
legal phrases, the other a dispensation from being personally
"invested" by the King‚Äîas Col. Legge explained, to safeguard
me as having a right to the Order in case anybody
says I was not "invested." ... Colonel Legge was a very
pleasant, jolly kind of man, and he told us he was in attendance
on the German Emperor when he was staying near
Christchurch last summer, and went for many drives with
the Emperor only, all about the country.... Col. Legge got
here at 2.40, and had to leave at 3.20 (at station), so we got
a carriage from Wimborne to meet the train and take him
back, and Ma gave him some tea, and he said he had got
a nice little place at Stoke Poges but with no view like
ours, and he showed me how to wear the Order and was
very pleasant: and we were all pleased....

<p class="tei tei-p">The next letter refers to the discovery of a rare moth
and some beetles in the root of an orchid. It was certainly
a strange yet pleasant coincidence that these creatures
should find themselves in Dr. Wallace&#39;s greenhouse, where
alone they would be noticed and appreciated as something
uncommon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Will,‚Äî ... In my last letter I did not say
anything about my morning at the Nat. Hist. Museum.... What
I enjoyed most was seeing some splendid New
Guinea butterflies which Mr. Rothschild<a name="noteref_47" id="noteref_47"></a><a href="#note_47"><span class="footnoteref">47</span></a> and his curator,
Mr. Jordan, brought up from Tring on purpose to show
me. I could hardly have imagined anything so splendid
as some of these. I also saw some of the new paradise
birds in the British Museum. But Mr. Rothschild says
they have five times as many at Tring, and much finer
specimens, and he invited me to spend a week-end at
Tring and see the Museum. So I may go, perhaps‚Äîin
the summer.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But I have a curious thing to tell you about insect
collecting at "Old Orchard." About five months back I
was examining one of the clumps of an orchid in the glass
case‚Äîwhich had been sent me from Buenos Ayres by Mr.
John Hall‚Äîwhen three pretty little beetles dropped out of
it, on the edge of the tank, and I only managed to catch
two of them. They were pretty little Longicornes, about
an inch long, but very slender and graceful, though only
of a yellowish-brown colour. I sent them up to the British
Museum asking the name, and telling them they could keep
them if of any use. They told me they were a species of
the large South American genus Ibidion, but they had not
got it in the collection!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On the Sunday before Christmas Day I was taking my
<span class="tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span>
<a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
evening inspection of the orchids, etc., in the glass case
when a largish insect flew by my face, and when it settled
it looked like a handsome moth or butterfly. It was brilliant
orange on the lower wings, the upper being shaded orange
brown, very moth-like, but the antenn√¶ were clubbed like
a butterfly&#39;s. At first I thought it was a butterfly that
mimicked a moth, but I had never seen anything like it
before.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Next morning I got a glass jar half filled with bruised
laurel leaves, and Ma got it in, and after a day or two
I set it, clumsily, and meant to take it to London, but
had no small box to put it in. I told Mr. Rothschild
about it, and he said it sounded like a Castnia‚Äîcurious
South American moths very near to butterflies. So he got
out the drawer with them, but mine was not there; then
he got another drawer half-empty, and there it was‚Äîonly a
coloured drawing, but exactly like. It had been described,
but neither the Museum nor Mr. Rothschild had got it! I
had had the orchids nearly a year and a half, so it must
have been, in the chrysalis all that time and longer, which
Mr. Rothschild said was the case with the Castnias. On
going home I searched, and found the brown chrysalis-case
it had come out of among the roots of the same orchid
the little Longicornes had dropped from. It is, I am pretty
sure, a Brazilian species, and I have written to ask Mr.
Hall if he knows where it came from. I have sent the moth
and chrysalis to Prof. Poulton (I had promised it to him at
the lecture) for the Oxford collection, and he is greatly
pleased with it; and especially with its history‚Äîone quite
small bit of an orchid, after more than a year in a greenhouse,
producing a rare or new beetle and an equally rare
moth!...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The Rev. O. Pickard-Cambridge has kindly written his
reminiscence of another very curious coincidence connected
with a natural history object.</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">"Some years ago, on looking over some insect drawers in
my collection, Mr. A.R. Wallace exclaimed, &#39;Why, there
is my old Sarawak spider!&#39; &#39;Well! that is curious,&#39; I
replied, &#39;because that spider has caused me much trouble
and thought as to who might have caught it, and where; I
had only lately decided to describe and figure it, even though
I could give the name of neither locality nor finder, being, as
it seemed to me, of a genus and species not as yet recorded;
also I had, as you see, provisionally conferred your name
upon it, although I had not the remotest idea that it had
anything else to do with you.&#39; &#39;Well,&#39; said Mr. Wallace,
&#39;if it is my old spider it ought to have my own private ticket
on the pin underneath.&#39; &#39;It has a ticket,&#39; I replied, &#39;but
it is unintelligible to me; the spider came to me among some
other items by purchase at the sale of Mr. Wilson Saunders&#39;
collections.&#39; &#39;If it is mine,&#39; said Wallace (examining it),
&#39;the ticket should be so-and-so. And it is! I caught this
spider at Sarawak, and specially noted its remarkable form.
I remember it as if it were yesterday, and now I find it here,
and you about to publish it as a new genus and species to
which, in total ignorance of whence it came or who caught
it, you have given my name!&#39; Thus it stands, and &#39;<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Friula
Wallacii</span>, Camb. (family Gasteracanthid√¶), taken by Alfred
Russel Wallace at Sarawak,&#39; is the (unique as I believe) type
specimen, in my collection."‚ÄîO.P.C.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Dr. Wallace was very fond of reading good novels, and
usually spent an hour or two, before retiring to bed, with
what he called a "good domestic story." One of his
favourite authors was Marion Crawford. Poetry appealed
to him very strongly, and he had a good memory for his
favourite verses, especially for those he had learned in
his youth. Amongst his books were over fifty volumes of
poetry.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He liked to see friends or interesting visitors, but he was
<span class="tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span>
<a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rather nervous with strangers until he became interested in
what they had to say. He enjoyed witty conversation, and
especially a good story well told. No one laughed more
heartily than he when he was much amused, and he would
slap his hands upon his knees with delight.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was very accessible to anyone who might have something
to say worth hearing, and he had a great many
visitors, especially during the last ten years of his life.
Many people distinguished in science, literature, or politics
called upon him, and he always enjoyed these visits, and the
excitement of them seemed to have no bad effect upon him,
even in the last year, when we sometimes feared he might be
fatigued by them. In consequence of his sympathy with
many heterodox ideas he frequently had visits from
"cranks" who wished to secure his support for some new
theory or "discovery." He would listen patiently, perhaps
ask a few questions, and then endeavour to point out their
fallacies. He would amuse us afterwards by describing their
"preposterous ideas," and if much bored, he would speak of
them as "muffs." He was loath to hurt their feelings, but
he generally ended by expressing his opinion quite clearly,
occasionally to their discomfiture.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Dr. Littledale has contributed some reminiscences which
may be introduced here.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">"When I first met Dr. Wallace the conversation turned
on the types of visitors that came to see him, and he gave us
an amusing account of two young women who called on him
to read through a most ponderous treatise relating to the
Universe (I think it was). At all events the treatise proved,
amongst other things, that Kepler&#39;s laws were all wrong.
Dr. Wallace was very busy at the time, and politely declined
to undertake the task. I remember him well describing with
his hands the size of this enormous manuscript and laughing
heartily as he detailed how the writer of the manuscript, the
elder of the two sisters, persistently tried to persuade him
that her theories were all absolutely proved in the work,
while the younger sister acted as a sort of echo to her sister.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span>
<a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The climax came in a fit of weeping, and, as Dr. Wallace
described it, the whole fabric of the universe was washed
away in a flood of tears.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"On one occasion, when I was asked by Mrs. Wallace to
see Dr. Wallace professionally, he was lying on the sofa in
his study by the fire wrapped up in rugs, having just got
over a bad shivering attack or rigor. His temperature was
104¬∞ Fahr., and all the other usual signs of acute fever were
present, but nothing to enable one to form a positive opinion
as to the cause. It must have been forty years since he had
been in the tropics, but I think he felt that it was an attack
of malarial fever. Knowing my patient, my treatment consisted
in asking what he was going to do for himself.
&#39;Well,&#39; he said, &#39;I am going to have a hot bath and then go
to bed, and to-morrow I shall get up and go into the garden
as usual.&#39; And he was out in the garden next day when I
went to see him. This was an instance, doubtless one of
many, of the &#39;will to live,&#39; which carried him through a
long life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Once, when he was talking about the gaps in the evolution
of life, viz. between the inorganic and organic, between
vegetable and animal, and between animal and man, I asked,
&#39;Why postulate a beginning at all? We are satisfied with
illimitability at one end, why not at the other?&#39; &#39;For the
simple reason,&#39; he said, &#39;that the mind cannot comprehend
anything that has never had a beginning.&#39;</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"What attracted me to him most, I think, was his remarkable
simplicity of language, whatever the topic of conversation
might be, and this not the simplicity of the great mind
bringing itself down to the level of the ordinary individual,
but his customary mode of expression. I have heard him say
that he felt the need of the fluency of speech which Huxley
possessed, as he had to cast about for the expression that he
wanted. This may have been the case when he was lecturing,
but I certainly never noticed it in conversation."‚ÄîH.E.L.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">

<p class="tei tei-p">Dr. Wallace was always interested in young men and
others who were going abroad with the intention of studying
Natural History, and gave them what advice and help he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page134">[pg 134]</span>
<a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
could. He much enjoyed listening to the accounts given by
travellers of the scenes, animals and plants and native life
they had seen, and deplored the so-called civilising of the
natives, which, in his opinion, generally meant their exploitation
by Europeans, leading to their deterioration and
extermination.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His nervousness with strangers sometimes led them to
form quite erroneous impressions. It occasionally found
expression in a nervous laugh which had nothing to do with
amusement or humour, but was often heard when he was
most serious and felt most deeply. One or two interviewers
described it as a "chuckle," an expression which suggested
feelings most opposite to those which he really experienced.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Although he could draw and sketch well, he did not
take much pleasure in it, and only exercised his skill when
there was a definite object in view. His sketches show
a very delicate touch, and denote painstaking accuracy,
while some are quite artistic. He much preferred drawing
with compasses and squares, there being a practical object
in his mind for which the plans or drawings were only the
first steps. Even in his ninety-first year he found much
enjoyment in drawing plans, and spent many hours in designing
alterations to a small cottage which his daughter
had bought.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was interested in literary puzzles and humorous
stories, and he preserved in an old scrap-book any that
appealed to him. He would sometimes read some of them on
festive occasions, or when we had children&#39;s parties, and
sometimes he laughed so heartily himself that he could not
go on reading.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In reviewing the years during which Dr. Wallace lived at
Broadstone, the last decade, when he was between eighty and
ninety years of age, this period seems to have been one of the
most eventful, and as full of work and mental activity as
any previous period. He never tired of his garden, in which
he succeeded in growing a number of rare and curious shrubs
and plants. Our mother shared his delight and interest in
the garden, and knew a great deal about flowers. She had
an excellent memory for their botanical names, and he often
<span class="tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span>
<a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
asked her the name of some plant which he was pointing out
to a friend and which for the moment he had forgotten. She
was very fond of roses and of primroses, and there was a
fine display of these flowers at "Old Orchard." She was
successful in "budding" and in hybridising roses, and produced
several beautiful varieties. She was proficient in
raising seeds, and he sometimes placed some which he
received from abroad in her charge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When he first came to live at Broadstone he frequently
took short walks to the post or to the bank, and sometimes
went by train to Poole on business, but he gradually went
out less and less, till in the last few years he seldom went
outside the garden, but strolled about looking at the flowers
or supervising the construction of a new bed or rockery.
During his last years his gardener wheeled him about the
garden in a bath-chair when he did not feel strong enough
to walk all the time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1913, after his last two small books were written,
he did no more writing except correspondence. This he
attended to himself, except on one or two occasions when
he was not very well or felt tired, when he asked one of
us to answer a few letters for him. He took great interest
in a small cottage which had recently been acquired on the
Purbeck Hills near the sea, and in September, much against
our wishes, he went there for two nights, taking the gardener
to look after him. Luckily the weather was fine, and the
change and excitement seemed to do him good, and during
the next month he was very bright and cheerful, though, as
some of his letters to his old friend Dr. Richard Norris and
to Dr. Littledale show, he had been becoming increasingly
weak.</p>

my fads that I hate to waste anything, and it is that partly
which makes it so difficult for me to avoid overeating. From

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Dr. Norris,‚ÄîExcept for a continuous weakness
I seem improving a little in general health, and the chronic
rheumatic pain in my right shoulder has almost passed away

the inflammation of the legs has somewhat diminished....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My increasing weakness is now my most serious trouble,
as it prevents me really from doing any more work, and
causes a large want of balance, and liability to fall
down. Even moving about the room after books, etc.,
dressing and undressing, make me want to lie down and
rest....</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">ALFRED R. WALLACE.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">

<p class="tei tei-p">In disposition Dr. Wallace was cheerful, and very
optimistic, and remarkably even-tempered. If irritated he
quickly recovered, and soon forgot all about the annoyance,
but he was always strongly indignant at any injustice to the
weak or helpless. When worried by business difficulties or
losses he very soon recovered his optimism, and seemed quite
confident that all would come right (as indeed it generally
did), and latterly he became convinced that all his past
troubles were really blessings in disguise, without which as
a stimulant he would have done no useful work.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His life was a happy one, and even the discomforts caused
by his ailments, which were at times very acute for days
together, never prevented him from enjoying the contemplation
of his flowers, nor disturbed the serenity of his temper,
nor caused him to complain.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Although rather delicate all his life, he rarely stayed in
bed; in fact, only once in our memory, during an illness at
Parkstone, did he do so, and then only for one day.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On Saturday, November 1st (1913), he walked round the
garden, and on the following day seemed very bright, and
enjoyed his dinner and supper, but about nine o&#39;clock he felt
faint and shivered violently. We called in Dr. Norman, who
came in about an hour, and we heard them having a long
talk and even laughing, in the study. As the doctor left
he said, "Wonderful man! he knows so much. I can do
nothing for him."
<span class="tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span>
<a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The next day he did not get up at the usual time, but we
felt no anxiety until noon, when he still showed no inclination
to rise. He appeared to be dozing, and said he wanted
nothing. From that time he gradually sank into semi-consciousness,
and at half-past nine in the morning of
Friday, November 7th, quietly passed on to that other life
in which he was such a firm believer.</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">"When a country is well governed, poverty and a mean condition are
things to be ashamed of. When a country is ill governed, riches and
honour are things to be ashamed of."‚ÄîCONFUCIUS.</p>
</blockquote>


<p class="tei tei-p">In the above sentences, written long before the dawn
of Christian civilisation, we have an apt summary of
the social and political views of Alfred Russel Wallace.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As we have stated in a previous chapter, it was during
his short stay in London as a boy, when he was led to study
the writings and methods of Robert Owen, of New Lanark,
that his mind first opened to the consideration of the inequalities
of our social life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">During the six years which he spent in land-surveying
he obtained a more practical knowledge of the laws pertaining
to public and private property as they affected the
lives and habits of both squire and peasant.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The village inn, or public-house, was then the only place
where men could meet to discuss topics of mutual interest,
and it was there that young Wallace and his brother spent
some of their own leisure hours listening to and conversing
with the village rustics. The conversation was not ordinarily
of an educational character, but occasionally experienced
farmers would discuss agricultural and land problems which
were beginning to interest Wallace.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In reading his books and essays written more than seventy
years later, we are struck with the exceptional opportunities
which he had of comparing social conditions, and commercial
and individual prosperity during that long period, and of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span>
<a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
witnessing the introduction of many inventions. He used to
enjoy recalling many of the discussions between intelligent
mechanics which he heard of in his early days regarding the
introduction of the steam-engine. One and another declared
that the grip of the engine on the rails would not be sufficient
to draw heavy trucks or carriages; that the wheels, in fact,
would whiz round instead of going on, and that it would
be necessary to sprinkle sand in front of the wheels, or
make the tyres rough like files. About this time, too, there
arose a keen debate upon the relative merits of the new
railroads and the old canals. Many thought that the
former could never compete with the latter in carrying
heavy goods; but facts soon proved otherwise, for in one
district alone the traffic of the canal, within two years of
the coming of the railway, decreased by 1,000,000 tons.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was during these years, and when he and his brother
were making a survey for the enclosure of some common
lands near Llandrindod Wells, that Wallace finally became
aware of the injustice towards the labouring classes of the
General Enclosure Act.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In this particular locality the land to be enclosed consisted
of a large extent of moor, and mountain which, with
other common rights, had for many years enabled the occupants
of the scattered cottages around to keep a horse, cow,
or a few sheep, and thus make a fairly comfortable living.
Under the Act, the whole of this open land was divided
among the adjacent landowners of the parish or manor, in
proportion to the size or value of their estates. Thus, to
those who actually possessed much, much was given; whilst
to those who only nominally owned a little land, even that
was taken away in return for a small compensation which
was by no means as valuable to them as the right to graze
their cattle. In spite of the statement set forth in the
General Enclosure Act‚Äî"Whereas it is expedient to facilitate
<span class="tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span>
<a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the enclosure and improvement of common and other
lands now subject to the rights of property which obstruct
cultivation and the productive employment of labour,"
Wallace ascertained many years later that no single part
of the land so enclosed had been cultivated by those to
whom it was given, though certain portions had been let
or sold at fabulous prices for building purposes, to accommodate
summer visitors to the neighbourhood. Thus the
unfortunate people who had formerly enjoyed home, health,
and comparative prosperity in the cottages scattered over
this common land had been obliged to migrate to the large
towns, seeking for fresh employment and means of subsistence,
or had become "law-created paupers"; whilst to
crown all, the piece of common originally "reserved" for
the benefit of the inhabitants had been turned into golf-links!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Again and again Wallace drew attention to the fundamental
duties of landownership, maintaining that the public,
as a whole, had become so blinded by custom that no
effectual social reform would ever be established unless
some strenuous and unremitting effort was made to recover
the land by law from those who had made the land laws
and who had niched the common heritage of humanity for
their own private aggrandisement.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With regard to the actual value of land, Wallace pointed
out that the last valuation was made in the year 1692, and
therefore, with the increase of value through minerals and
other products since then, the arrears of land tax due up
to 1905 would amount to more than the value of all the
agricultural land of our country at the present time; therefore
existing landlords, in clamouring for their alleged
rights of property, might find out that those "rights" no
longer exist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Yet another point on which he insisted was the right of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span>
<a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
way through fields or woodlands, and especially beside the
sea. With the advent of the motor-car and other swift
means of locomotion, the public roads are no longer safe
and pleasurable for pedestrians; besides the iniquitous fact
that hundreds are kept from enjoying the beauties of nature
by the utterly selfish and useless reservations of such by-paths
by the landowner.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"This all-embracing system of land-robbery," again he
writes, "for which nothing is too great or too small; which
has absorbed meadow and forest, moor and mountain, which
has appropriated most of our rivers and lakes and the fish
that live in them; making the agriculturist pay for his seaweed
manure and the fisherman for his bait of shell-fish;
which has desolated whole counties to replace men by sheep
or cattle, and has destroyed fields and cottages to make a
wilderness for deer and grouse; which has stolen the commons
and filched the roadside wastes; which has driven the
labouring poor into the cities, and thus been the chief cause
of the misery, disease, and early death of thousands ... it
is the advocates of this inhuman system who, when a partial
restitution of their unholy gains is proposed, are the loudest
in their cries of &#39;robbery&#39;!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"But all the robbery, all the spoliation, all the legal and
illegal filching, has been on <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">their</span> side.... They made the
laws to legalise their actions, and, some day, we, the people,
will make laws which will not only legalise but justify our
process of restitution. It will justify it, because, unlike their
laws, which always took from the poor to give to the rich‚Äîto
the very class which made the laws‚Äîours will only take
from the superfluity of the rich, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">not</span> to give to the poor or
to any individuals, but to so administer as to enable every
man to live by honest work, to restore to the whole people
their birthright in their native soil, and to relieve all alike
from a heavy burden of unnecessary and unjust taxation.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span>
<a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">This</span> will be the true statesmanship of the future, and it will
be justified alike by equity, by ethics, and by religion."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">These, then, are the facts and reasons upon which Dr.
Wallace based his strenuous advocacy of Land Nationalisation.<a name="noteref_49" id="noteref_49"></a><a href="#note_49"><span class="footnoteref">49</span></a>
It was only by slow degrees that he arrived at some
of the conclusions propounded in his later years, but once
having grasped their full importance to the social and moral
well-being of the community, he held them to the last.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first book which tended to fasten his attention upon
these matters was "Social Statics," by Herbert Spencer, but
in 1870 the publication of his "Malay Archipelago" brought
him into personal contact with John Stuart Mill, through
whose invitation he became a member of the General Committee
of the Land Tenure Reform Association. On the
formation of the Land Nationalisation Society in 1880 he
retired from the Association, and devoted himself to the
larger issues which the new Society embraced.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Soon after the latter Society was started, Henry George,
the American author of "Progress and Poverty," came to
England, and Wallace had many opportunities of hearing
him speak in public and of discussing matters of common
interest in private. In spite of the ridicule poured upon
Henry George&#39;s book by many eminent social reformers,
Wallace consistently upheld its general principles.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His second work on these various subjects was a small
book entitled "Bad Times," issued in 1885, in which
he went deeply into the root causes of the depression in
trade which had lasted since 1874. The facts there given
were enlarged upon and continually brought up to date in
his later writings. Articles which had appeared in various
magazines were gathered together and included, with those
on other subjects, in "Studies, Scientific and Social." His
last three books, which include his ideas on social diseases
<span class="tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span>
<a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the best method of preventing them, were "The Wonderful
Century," "Social Environment and Moral Progress,"
and "The Revolt of Democracy"; the two last
being issued, as we have seen, in 1913, the year of his
death.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In "Social Environment and Moral Progress" the conclusion
of his vehement survey of our moral and social
conditions was startling: "<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">It is not too much to say that
our whole system of Society is rotten from top to bottom,
and that the social environment as a whole in relation to
our possibilities and our claims is the worst that the world
has ever seen</span>."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">That terrible indictment was doubly underscored in
his MS.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">What, in his mature judgment, were the causes and
remedies? He set them out in this order:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">1. The evils are due, broadly and generally, to our living
under a system of universal competition for the means of
existence, the remedy for which is equally universal co-operation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">2. It may also be defined as a system of economic
antagonism, as of enemies, the remedy being a system
of economic brotherhood, as of a great family, or of
friends.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">3. Our system is also one of monopoly by a few of all
the means of existence‚Äîthe land, without access to which
no life is possible; and capital, or the results of stored-up
labour, which is now in the possession of a limited number
of capitalists, and therefore is also a monopoly. The remedy
is freedom of access to land and capital for all.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">4. Also, it may be defined as social injustice, inasmuch as
the few in each generation are allowed to inherit the stored-up
wealth of all preceding generations, while the many
inherit nothing. The remedy is to adopt the principle of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span>
<a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
equality of opportunity for all, or of universal <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">inheritance
by the State in trust for the whole community</span>.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We have," he finally concluded, "ourselves created an
immoral or unmoral social environment. To undo its inevitable
results we must reverse our course. We must see
that <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all</span> our economic legislation, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all</span> our social reforms, are
in the very opposite direction to those hitherto adopted, and
that they tend in the direction of one or other of the four
fundamental remedies I have suggested. In this way only
can we hope to change our existing immoral environment
into a moral one, and <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">initiate a new era of Moral Progress.</span>"
The "Revolt of Democracy"<a name="noteref_50" id="noteref_50"></a><a href="#note_50"><span class="footnoteref">50</span></a> was addressed directly to
the Labour Party. And once again he drew a vivid picture
of how, during the whole of the nineteenth century, there
was a continuous advance in the application of scientific
discovery to the arts, especially to the invention and application
of labour-saving machinery; and how our wealth
had increased to an equally marvellous extent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He pointed out that various estimates which had been
made of the increase in our wealth-producing capacity
showed that, roughly speaking, the use of mechanical
power had increased it more than a hundredfold during
the century; yet the result had been to create a limited
upper class, living in unexampled luxury, while about one-fourth
of the whole population existed in a state of fluctuating
penury, often sinking below the margin of poverty. Many
thousands were annually drawn into this gulf of destitution,
and died from direct starvation and premature exhaustion or
from diseases produced by unhealthy employment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">During this long period, however, although wealth and
want had alike increased side by side, public opinion had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span>
<a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not been sufficiently educated to permit of any effectual
remedy being applied. The workers themselves had failed
to visualise its fundamental causes, land monopoly and
the competitive system of industry giving rise to an ever-increasing
private capitalism which, to a very large extent,
had controlled the Legislature. All through the last century
this rapid accumulation of wealth due to extensive manufacturing
industries led to a still greater increase of middlemen
engaged in the distribution of the products, from the wealthy
merchant to the various grades of tradesmen and small shop-keepers
who supplied the daily wants of the community.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To those who lived in the midst of this vast industrial
system, or were a part of it, it seemed natural and inevitable
that there should be rich and poor; and this belief was enforced
on the one hand by the clergy, and on the other by
political economists, so that religion and science agreed in
upholding the competitive and capitalistic system of society
as the only rational and possible one. Hence it came to be
believed that the true sphere of governmental action did not
include the abolition of poverty. It was even declared that
poverty was due to economic causes over which governments
had no power; that wages were kept down by the "iron
law" of supply and demand; and that any attempt to find
a remedy by Acts of Parliament only aggravated the disease.
During the Premiership of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
this attitude was, for the first time, changed. On numerous
occasions Sir Henry declared that he held it to be the duty
of a government to deal with problems of unemployment and
poverty.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1908 three great strikes, coming in rapid succession‚Äîthose
of the Railway and other Transport Unions, the
Miners, and the London Dock Labourers‚Äîbrought home to
the middle and upper classes, and to the Government, how
completely all are dependent on the "working classes." This
<span class="tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span>
<a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and similar experiences showed us that when the organisation
of the trade unions was more complete, and the accumulated
funds of several years were devoted to this purpose, the bulk
of the inhabitants of London, and of other great cities, could
be made to suffer a degree of famine comparable with that
of Paris when besieged by the German army in 1870.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace&#39;s watchword throughout these social agitations
was "Equality of Opportunity for All," and the ideal
method by which he hoped to achieve this end was a system
of industrial colonisation in our own country whereby <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all</span>
would have a fair, if not an absolutely equal, share in the
benefits arising from the production of their own labour,
whether physical or mental.<a name="noteref_51" id="noteref_51"></a><a href="#note_51"><span class="footnoteref">51</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">With regard to the education of the people, especially
as a stepping-stone to moral and intellectual reform, Wallace
believed in the training of individual natural talent,
rather than the present system of general education thrust
upon every boy or girl regardless of their varying mental
capacities. He also urged that the building-up of the mind
should be alternated with physical training in one or more
useful trades, so that there might be, not only at the outset,
but also in later life, a choice of occupation in order
to avoid the excess of unemployment in any one direction.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In his opinion, one of the injurious results of our competitive
system, having its roots, however, in the valuable
"guilds" of a past epoch, was the almost universal restriction
of our workers to only one kind of labour. The
result was a dreadful monotony in almost all spheres of
work, the extreme unhealthiness of many, and a much
larger amount of unemployment than if each man or
woman were regularly trained in two or more occupations.
In addition to two of what are commonly called trades,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span>
<a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every youth should be trained for one day a week or one
week in a month, according to the demand for labour, in
some of the various operations of farming or gardening.
Not only would this improve the general health of the
workers, but it would also add much to the interest and
enjoyment of their lives.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"There is one point," he wrote, "in connection with
this problem which I do not think has ever been much considered
or discussed. It is the undoubted benefit to all the
members of a society of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">the greatest possible diversity of
character</span>, as a means both towards the greatest enjoyment
and interest of association, and to the highest ultimate development
of the race. If we are to suppose that man might
have been created or developed with none of those extremes
of character which now often result in what we call wickedness,
vice, or crime, there would certainly have been a greater
monotony in human nature, which would, perhaps, have led
to less beneficial results than the variety which actually
exists may lead to. We are more and more getting to see
that very much, perhaps all, the vice, crime, and misery
that exists in the world is the result, not of the wickedness
of individuals, but of the entire absence of sympathetic
training from infancy onwards. So far as I have heard,
the only example of the effects of such a training on a large
scale was that initiated by Robert Owen at New Lanark,
which, with most unpromising materials, produced such
marvellous results on the character and conduct of the
children as to seem almost incredible to the numerous
persons who came to see and often critically to examine
them. There must have been all kinds of characters in
his schools, yet <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">none</span> were found to be incorrigible, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">none</span>
beyond control, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">none</span> who did not respond to the love and
sympathetic instruction of their teachers. It is therefore
quite possible that <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all</span> the evil in the world is directly due
<span class="tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span>
<a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to man, not to God, and that when we once realise this to
its full extent we shall be able, not only to eliminate almost
completely what we now term evil, but shall then clearly
perceive that all those propensities and passions that under
bad conditions of society inevitably led to it, will under good
conditions add to the variety and the capacities of human
nature, the enjoyment of life by all, and at the same time
greatly increase the possibilities of development of the whole
race. I myself feel confident that this is really the case, and
that such considerations, when followed out to their ultimate
issues, afford a complete solution of the great problem of the
ages‚Äîthe origin of evil."<a name="noteref_52" id="noteref_52"></a><a href="#note_52"><span class="footnoteref">52</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Closely allied with the welfare of the child is another
"reform" with which Wallace&#39;s name will long be associated.
That is his strong denunciation of Vaccination.
For seven years he laboured to show medical and scientific
men that statistics proved beyond doubt the futility of this
measure to prevent disease. A few were converted, but
public opinion is hard to move.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In his ideal of the future, Dr. Wallace gave a large and
honoured sphere to women. He considered that it was in
the highest degree presumptuous and irrational to attempt
to deal by compulsory enactments with the most vital and
most sacred of all human relationships, regardless of the
fact that our present phase of social development is not
only extremely imperfect, but, as already shown, vicious
and rotten to the core. How could it be possible to determine
by legislation those relations of the sexes which shall
be best alike for individuals and for the race in a society in
which a large proportion of our women are forced to work
long hours daily for the barest subsistence, with an almost
total absence of the rational pleasures of life, for the want
of which thousands are driven into uncongenial marriages
<span class="tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span>
<a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in order to secure some amount of personal independence
or physical well-being. He believed that when men and
women are, for the first time in the course of civilisation,
equally free to follow their best impulses; when idleness
and vicious and hurtful luxury on the one hand, and
oppressive labour and the dread of starvation on the
other, are alike unknown; when <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">all</span> receive the best and
broadest education that the state of civilisation and knowledge
will admit; when the standard of public opinion
is set by the wisest and the best among us, and that
standard is systematically inculcated in the young‚Äîthen
we shall find that a system of truly "Natural Selection"
(a term that Wallace preferred to "Eugenics," which he
utterly disliked) will come spontaneously into action which
will tend steadily to eliminate the lower, the less developed,
or in any way defective types of men, and will thus continuously
raise the physical, moral, and intellectual standard of
the race.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He further held that "although many women now remain
unmarried from necessity rather than from choice, there are
always considerable numbers who feel no strong impulse to
marriage, and accept husbands to secure subsistence and a
home of their own rather than from personal affection or
sexual emotion. In a state of society in which all women
were economically independent, where all were fully occupied
with public duties and social or intellectual pleasures, and
had nothing to gain by marriage as regards material well-being
or social position, it is highly probable that the numbers
of unmarried from choice would increase. It would
probably come to be considered a degradation for any
woman to marry a man whom she could not love and
esteem, and this reason would tend at least to delay
marriage till a worthy and sympathetic partner was encountered."
<span class="tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span>
<a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But this choice, he considered, would be further
strengthened by the fact that, with the ever-increasing
approach to equality of opportunity for every child born
in our country, that terrible excess of male deaths, in
boyhood and early manhood especially, due to various
preventable causes, would disappear, and change the
present majority of women to a majority of men. This
would lead to a greater rivalry for wives, and give to
women the power of rejecting all the lower types of
character among their suitors.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"It will be their special duty so to mould public
opinion, through home training and social influence, as to
render the women of the future the regenerators of the
entire human race." He fully hoped and believed that
they would prove equal to the high and responsible position
which, in accordance with natural laws, they will be
called upon to fulfil.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. D.A. Wilson, who visited him in 1912, writes:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He surprised me by saying he was a Socialist‚Äîone
does not expect a man like him to label himself in any
way. It appeared to be unconscious modesty, like a school-boy&#39;s,
which made him willing to be labelled; but no label
could describe him, and his mental sweep was unlimited.
Although in his ninetieth year, he seemed to be in his prime.
There was no sign of age but physical weakness, and you
had to make an effort at times to remember even that. His
eye kindled as he spoke, and more than once he walked about
and chuckled, like a schoolboy pleased.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">An earnest expression like Carlyle&#39;s came over his countenance
as he reprobated the selfish, wild-cat competition which
made life harder and more horrible to-day for a well-doing
poor man in England than among the Malays or Burmese
before they had any modern inventions. Co-operation was
the upward road for humanity. Men grew out of beasthood
by it, and by it civilisation began. Forgetting it, men
<span class="tei-pb" id="page152">[pg 152]</span>
<a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
retrograded, subsiding swiftly, so that there were many
individuals among us to-day who were in body, mind, and
character below the level of our barbarian ancestors or
contemporary "savages," to say nothing of civilised Burmese
or Malays. What he meant by Socialism can be seen
from his books. Nothing in them surprised me after our
talk. His appreciation of Confucius, when I quoted some
things of the Chinese sage&#39;s which confirmed what he was
saying, was emphatic, and that and many other things
showed that Socialism to him implied the upward evolution
of humanity. It was because of the degradation of
men involved that he objected to letting individuals grab
the public property‚Äîearth, air and water. Monopolies, he
thought, should at once revert to the public, and we had an
argument which showed that he had no objection to even
artificial monopolies if they were public property. He defended
the old Dutch Government monopolies of spices, and
declared them better than to-day&#39;s free trade, when cultivation
is exploited by men who always tended to be mere
money-grabbers, selfish savages let loose. In answer I
mentioned the abuses of officialdom, as seen by me from
the inside in Burma, and he agreed that the mental and
moral superiority of many kinds of Asiatics to the Europeans
who want to boss them made detailed European
administration an absurdity. We should leave these peoples
to develop in their own way. Having conquered Burma
and India, he proceeded, the English should take warning
from history and restrict themselves to keeping the
peace, and protecting the countries they had taken. They
should give every province as much home rule as possible
and as soon as possible, and study to avoid becoming
parasites.‚ÄîD.A.W.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">We may fittingly conclude this brief summary of
Wallace&#39;s social views and ideals by citing his own reply to
the question: "Why am I a Socialist?" "I am a Socialist
because I believe that the highest law for mankind is justice.
I therefore take for my motto, &#39;Fiat Justitia, Ruat
Coelum&#39;; and my definition of Socialism is, &#39;The use, by
<span class="tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span>
<a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
everyone, of his faculties for the common good, and the
voluntary organisation of labour for the equal benefit of
all.&#39; That is absolute social justice; that is ideal Socialism.
It is, therefore, the guiding star for all true social
reform."</p>

with the general aims of your proposed Land

glanced at that I should fundamentally disagree with the
writer, and have not read more.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I demur entirely to the supposition, which is implied in
the book, that by any possible social arrangements whatever
the distress which humanity has to suffer in the course
of civilisation could have been prevented. The whole process,
with all its horrors and tyrannies, and slaveries, and
wars, and abominations of all kinds, has been an inevitable
one accompanying the survival and spread of the strongest,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span>
<a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the consolidation of small tribes into large societies; and
among other things the lapse of land into private ownership
has been, like the lapse of individuals into slavery, at one
period of the process altogether indispensable. I do not in
the least believe that from the primitive system of communistic
ownership to a high and finished system of State
ownership, such as we may look for in the future, there
could be any transition without passing through such
stages as we have seen and which exist now. Argument
aside, however, I should be disinclined to commit myself
to any scheme of immediate action, which, as I have indicated
to you, I believe at present premature. For myself
I feel that I have to consider not only what I may do on
special questions, but also how the action I take on special
questions may affect my general influence; and I am disinclined
to give more handles against me than are needful.
Already, as you will see by the enclosed circular, I am doing
in the way of positive action more than may be altogether
prudent.‚ÄîSincerely yours,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Violet,‚Äî ... I am quite in favour of a legal
eight hours&#39; day. Overtime need not be forbidden, but
every man who works overtime should have a legal claim
to double wages for the extra hours. That would make it
cheaper for the master to employ two sets of men working
each eight hours when they had long jobs requiring them,
while for the necessities of finishing contracts, etc., they
could well afford to pay double for the extra hours. "It
would make everything dearer!" Of course it would!
How else can you produce a more equal distribution of
wealth than by making the rich and idle pay more and
the workers receive more? "The workers would have to
pay more, too, for everything they bought!" True again,
but what they paid more would not equal their extra earnings,
because a large portion of the extra pay to the men
will be paid by the rich, and only the remainder paid by
the men themselves. The eight hours&#39; day and double pay
for overtime would not only employ thousands now out of
work, but would actually raise wages per hour and per day.
This is clear, because wages are kept down wholly by the
surplus supply of labour in every trade. The moment the
surplus is used up, or nearly so, by more men being required
on account of shorter hours, competition among the men
becomes less; among the employers, for men, more: hence
necessarily higher wages all round. As to the bogey of
foreign competition, it is a bogey only. All the political
economists agree that if wages are raised in all trades, it
will not in the least affect our power to export goods as
profitably as now. Look and see! And, secondly, the eight
hours&#39; movement is an international one, and will affect all
alike in the end.

I have read your tract on "Justice, not Charity,"

with great pleasure and approval. The moment Mr. Benjamin
Kidd invented the striking term of "equality of
opportunity" I adopted it, and have often preached it in
the pulpit and on the platform, just as you preach it in the
tract before me. I fully agree that justice, not charity, is
the fundamental principle of social reform. There is something
very contemptible in the spiteful way in which many
newspapers and magistrates are trying to aggravate the difficulties
of conscientious men who avail themselves of the conscience
clause in the new Vaccination Act. There is very
much to be done yet before social justice is realised, but the
astonishing manifesto of the Czar of Russia, which I have no
doubt is a perfectly sincere one, is a revelation of the extent
to which social truth is leavening European society. Since
I last wrote to you I have been elected President of the
Wesleyan Methodist Conference, which will give me a great
deal of special work and special opportunities also, I am
thankful to say, of propagating Social Christianity, which
in fact, and to a great extent in form, is what you yourself

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir,‚ÄîI look upon you as the one politician left to
us, who, by his ability and integrity, his eloquence and love
of truth, his high standing as a thinker and writer, and his
openness of mind, is able to become the leader of the English
people in their struggle for freedom against the monopolists
of land, capital, and political power. I therefore take the
liberty of sending you herewith a book of mine containing a
number of miscellaneous essays, a few of which, I venture
to think, are worthy of your serious attention.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Some time since you intimated in one of your speeches
that, if the choice for this country were between Imperialism
and Socialism, you were inclined to consider the latter the
less evil of the two. You added, I think, your conviction
that the dangers of Socialism to human character were what
most influenced you against it. I trust that my impression
of what you said is substantially correct. Now I myself
believe, after a study of the subject extending over twenty
years, that this danger is non-existent, and certainly does
not in any way apply to the fundamental principles of
Socialism, which is, simply, <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">the voluntary organisation of
labour for the good of all</span>....‚ÄîWith great esteem, I am

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Sir,‚ÄîFor some reason, though your letter is
dated the 20th, it has only reached me, along with the two
volumes, to-day. I feel myself greatly indebted to you for
both. In older days I often mused upon a passage of yours
in the "Malay Archipelago" contrasting the condition of
certain types of savage life with that of life in a modern
<span class="tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span>

in these pages, new to me, where you come to close
quarters with the problem.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">But my time and my mind are at present neither of
them free for the effective consideration of this mighty
case. Nor can I promise myself the requisite leisure for
at least several months to come. What I can do is to set
your arguments a-simmering in my brain, and perhaps
when the time of liberation arrives I may be in a state
to make something of it. I don&#39;t suppose that I shall be
a convert, but I always remember J.S. Mill&#39;s observation,
after recapitulating the evils to be apprehended
from Socialism, that he would face them in spite of all, if
the only alternative to Socialism were our present state.‚ÄîWith

Parliament Bill in excitement. On receipt of Friday&#39;s
paper, I sat down and composed and sent off to Lloyd
George a short but big letter, on large foolscap paper,
urging him and Asquith, as the two strong men of the
Government, to take over at once the management of the
railways of the entire country, by Royal Proclamation‚Äîon
the ground of mismanagement for seventy years, and
having brought the country to the verge of starvation and
civil war; to grant an amnesty to all strikers (except for
acts of violence), also grant all the men&#39;s demands for one
year, and devote that time to a deliberate and impartial
inquiry and a complete scheme of reorganisation of the
railways in the interest, first of the public, then of the
men of all grades, lastly of the share and bond owners,
who will become guaranteed public creditors.... It has
been admitted and proved again and again, that the men
are badly treated, that their grievances are real‚Äîtheir very
unanimity and standing by each other proves it. Their
demands are most moderate; and the cost in extra wages
<span class="tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span>

will be saved over and over in safety, regularity, economy

<h3 class="tei tei-head">I.‚ÄîAstronomy</h3>


<p class="tei tei-p">Of the varied subjects upon which Wallace wrote, none,
perhaps, came with greater freshness to the general
reader than his books written when he was nearly
eighty upon the ancient science of astronomy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps he would have said that the "directive Mind
and Purpose" kept these subjects back until the closing
years of his life in order that he might bring to bear
upon them his wider knowledge of nature, enlightened
by that spiritual perception which led him to link the
heavens and the earth in one common bond of evolution,
culminating in the development of moral and spiritual
intelligences.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Man&#39;s Place in the Universe" (1903) was in effect a
prelude to "The World of Life" (1910). Wallace saw
afterwards that one grew out of the other, as we find him
frequently saying with regard to his other books and
essays.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As with Spiritualism, so with Astronomy, the seed-interest
practically lay dormant in his mind for many
years; with this difference, however, that temperament
and training caused a speedy unfolding of his mind when
once a scientific subject gripped him, whereas with Spiritualism
he felt the need of moving slowly and cautiously
before fully accepting the phenomena as verifiable facts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was during the later period of his land-surveying,
when he was somewhere between the ages of 18 and 20,
that he became distinctly interested in the stars. Being
<span class="tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span>
<a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
left much alone at this period, he began to vary his pursuits
by studying a book on Nautical Astronomy, and
constructing a rude telescope.<a name="noteref_56" id="noteref_56"></a><a href="#note_56"><span class="footnoteref">56</span></a> This primitive appliance
increased his interest in other astronomical instruments,
and especially in the grand onward march of astronomical
discovery, which he looked upon as one of the wonders of
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was the inclusion of astronomy in lectures he delivered
at Davos which led him to extend his original brief notes
into the four chapters which form an important part of his
"Wonderful Century." He freely confessed that in order
to write these chapters he was obliged to read widely, and
to make much use of friends to whom astronomy was a
more familiar study. And it was whilst he was engaged
upon these chapters that his attention became riveted upon
the unique position of our planet in relation to the solar
system.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He had noticed that certain definite conditions appeared to
be absolutely essential to the origin and development of the
higher types of terrestrial life, and that most of these must
have been certainly dependent on a very delicate balance of
the forces concerned in the evolution of our planet. Our
position in the solar system appeared to him to be peculiar
and unique because, he thought, we may be almost sure
that these conditions do not coexist on any other planet,
and that we have no good reason to believe that other
planets could have maintained over a period of millions of
years the complex and equable conditions absolutely necessary
to the existence of the higher forms of terrestrial life.
Therefore it appeared to him to be proved that our earth
does really stand alone in the solar system by reason of
its special adaptation for the development of human life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Granting this, however, the question might still be asked,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span>
<a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Why should not any one of the suns in other parts of space
possess planets as well adapted as our own to develop the
higher forms of organic life? These questions cannot be
answered definitely; but there are reasons, he considered,
why the central position which we occupy may alone be
suitable. It is almost certain that electricity and other
mysterious radiant forces (of which we have so recently
discovered the existence) have played an important part
in the origin and development of organised life, and it
does not appear to be extravagant to assume that the
extraordinary way in which these cosmic forces have
remained hidden from us may be due to that central
position which we are found to occupy in the whole universe
of matter discoverable by us. Indeed, it may well
be that these wonderful forces of the ether are more
irregular‚Äîand perhaps more violent‚Äîin their effect upon
matter in what may be termed the outer chambers of that
universe, and that they are only so nicely balanced, so
uniform in their action, and so concealed from us, as to
be fit to aid in the development of organic life in that
central portion of the stellar system which our globe
occupies. Should these views as to the unique central
position of our earth be supported by the results of further
research, it will certainly rank as the most extraordinary
and perhaps the most important of the many discoveries
of the past century.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">While still working on this section of his "Wonderful
Century," he was asked to write a scientific article, upon
any subject of his own choice, for the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">New York Independent</span>.
And as the idea of the unique position of the
earth to be the abode of human life was fresh in his mind,
he thought it would prove interesting to the general public.
However, before his article appeared simultaneously in the
American papers and in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Fortnightly Review</span>, a friend
<span class="tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span>
<a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
who read it was so impressed with its originality and treatment
that he persuaded Wallace to enlarge it into book
form; and it appeared in the autumn of 1903 as "Man&#39;s
Place in the Universe."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This fascinating treatise upon the position occupied
by the earth, and man, in the universe, had the same
effect as some of his former writings, of drawing forth unstinted
commendation from many religious and secular
papers; whilst the severely scientific and materialistic reviewers
doubted how far his imagination had superseded
unbiased reason.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">On one point, however, most outsiders were in agreement‚Äîthat
he had invested an ancient subject with freshest interest
through approaching it by an entirely new way. The
plan followed was that of bringing together all the positive
conclusions of the astronomer, the geologist, the physicist,
and the biologist, and by weighing these carefully in the
balance he arrived at what appeared to him to be the only
reasonable conclusion. He therefore set out to solve the
problem whether or not the logical inferences to be drawn
from the various results of modern science lent support to
the view that our earth is the only inhabited planet, not
only in our own solar system, but in the whole stellar universe.
In the course of his close and careful exposition
he takes the reader through the whole trend of modern
scientific research, concluding with a summing-up of his
deductions in the following six propositions, in the first
three of which he sets out the conclusions reached by
modern astronomers:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(1) That the stellar universe forms one connected whole;
and, though of enormous extent, is yet finite, and its extent
determinable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(2) That the solar system is situated in the plane of the
Milky Way, and not far removed from the centre of that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span>
<a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
plane. The earth is, therefore, nearly in the centre of the
stellar universe.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(3) That this universe consists throughout of the same
kinds of matter, and is subjected to the same physical and
chemical laws.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The conclusions which I claim to have shown to have
enormous probabilities in their favour are:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(4) That no other planet in the solar system than our
earth is inhabited or habitable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(5) That the probabilities are almost as great against
any other sun possessing inhabited planets.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(6) That the nearly central position of our sun is probably
a permanent one, and has been specially favourable,
perhaps absolutely essential, to life-development on the
earth.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace never maintained that this earth alone in the
whole universe is the abode of life. What he maintained
was, first, that our solar system appears to be in or near
the centre of the visible universe, and, secondly, that all
the available evidence supports the idea of the extreme unlikelihood
of there being on any star or planet revealed by
the telescope any intelligent life either identical with or
analogous to man. To suppose that this one particular
type of universe extends over all space was, he considered,
to have a low idea of the Creator and His power. Such a
scheme would mean monotony instead of infinite variety,
the keynote of things as they are known to us. There
might be a million universes, but all different.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To his mind there was no difficulty in believing in the
existence of consciousness apart from material organism;
though he could not readily conceive of pure mind, or
pure spirit, apart from some kind of substantial envelope
or substratum. Many of the views suggested in "Man&#39;s
Place in the Universe" as to man&#39;s spiritual progress
hereafter, the reason or ultimate purpose for which he
<span class="tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span>
<a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was brought into existence, were enlarged upon, later, in
"The World of Life." As early, however, as 1903, Wallace
did not hesitate to express his own firm conviction
that Science and Spiritualism were in many ways closely
akin.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He believed that the near future would show the strong
tendency of scientists to become more religious or spiritual.
The process, he thought, would be slow, as the general attitude
has never been more materialistic than now. A few
have been bold enough to assert their belief in some outside
power, but the leading scientific men are, as a rule,
dead against them. "They seem," he once remarked, "to
think, and to like to think, that the whole phenomena of
life will one day be reduced to terms of matter and motion,
and that every vegetable, animal, and human product will
be explained, and may some day be artificially produced, by
chemical action. But even if this were so, behind it all
there would still remain an unexplained mystery."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Closely associated with "Man&#39;s Place in the Universe"
is a small volume, "Is Mars Habitable?" This was first
commenced as a review of Professor Percival Lowell&#39;s book,
"Mars and its Canals," with the object of showing that the
large amount of new and interesting facts contained in this
work did not invalidate the conclusion that he (Wallace) had
reached in 1903‚Äîthat Mars is not habitable. The conclusions
to which his argument led him were these:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(1) All physicists are agreed that ... Mars would have
a mean temperature of about 35¬∞ F. owing to its distance
from the sun.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(2) But the very low temperatures on the earth under
the equator at a height where the barometer stands at
about three times as high as on Mars, proves that from
scantiness of atmosphere alone Mars cannot possibly have
a temperature as high as the freezing-point of water.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span>
<a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The combination of these two results must bring down
the temperature of Mars to a degree wholly incompatible
with the existence of animal life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">(3) The quite independent proof that water-vapour cannot
exist on Mars, and that, therefore, the first essential
of organic life‚Äîwater‚Äîis non-existent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The conclusion from these three independent proofs ... is
therefore irresistible‚Äîthat animal life, especially in its
highest forms, cannot exist. Mars, therefore, is not only
uninhabited by intelligent beings ... but is absolutely uninhabitable.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">In contrast to his purely scientific interest in astronomy,
Wallace was moved by the romance of the "stars," akin to
his enthusiastic love of beautiful butterflies. Had it not
been for this touch of romance and idealism in his writings
on astronomy, they would have lost much of their charm
for the general reader. His breadth of vision transforms
him from a mere student of astronomy into a seer who
became ever more deeply conscious of the mystery both
"before and behind."</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">

<p class="tei tei-l">Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?</p>
<p class="tei tei-l">From the great deep to the great deep he goes."</p>
</div>

<p class="tei tei-p">And whilst facing with brave and steady mind the great
mysteries of earth and sky, of life and what lies beyond it,
he himself loved to quote:</p>

<div style="text-align: left" class="tei tei-lg">

help when writing his astronomical books was Prof. (now

<h3 class="tei tei-head">TO PROF. BARRETT</h3>


<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Parkstone, Dorset. February 12, 1901.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Barrett,‚ÄîI shall be much obliged if you will
give me your opinion on a problem in physics that I cannot
find answered in any book. It relates to the old Nebular
Hypothesis, and is this:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is assumed that the matter of the solar system was
once wholly gaseous, and extended as a roughly globular
or lenticular mass beyond the orbit of Neptune. Sir
Robert Ball stated in a lecture here that even when the
solar nebula had shrunk to the size of the earth&#39;s orbit it
must have been (I think he said) hundreds of times rarer
than the residual gas in one of Crookes&#39;s high vacuum
tubes. Yet, by hypothesis, it was hot enough, even in its
outer portions, to retain all the solid elements in the
gaseous state.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Now, admitting this to be <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">possible</span> at any given epoch,
my difficulty is this: how long could the outer parts
of this nebula exist, exposed to the zero temperature of
surrounding space, without losing the gaseous state and
aggregating into minute solid particles‚Äîinto meteoric
dust, in fact?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Could it exist an hour? a day? a year? a century? Yet
the process of condensation from the Neptunian era to that
of Saturn or Jupiter must surely have occupied millions of
centuries. What kept the almost infinitely rare metallic
gases in the gaseous state all this time? Is such a condition
of things physically possible?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I cannot myself imagine any such condition of things
as the supposed primitive solar nebula as possibly coming
into existence under any conceivably antecedent conditions,
but, granted that it did come into existence, it seems to me
that the gaseous state must almost instantly begin changing
<span class="tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span>
<a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
into the solid state. Hence I adopt the meteoric theory
instead of the nebular; since all the evidence is in favour
of solid matter being abundant all through known space,
while there is no evidence of metallic gases existing in
space, except as the result of collisions of huge masses of
matter. Is my difficulty a mare&#39;s nest?‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mrs. Fisher,‚ÄîThanks for your letter. Am sorry
I have not converted you, but perhaps it will come yet! I
will only make one remark as to your conclusion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I have not attempted to prove a negative! That is not
necessary. What I claim to have done is, to have shown
that all the evidence we have, be it much or little, is decidedly
against not only other solar planets having inhabitants,
but also, as far as probabilities are concerned, equally
against it in any supposed stellar planets‚Äîfor not one has
been proved to exist. There is absolutely no evidence which
shows even a probability of there being other inhabited
worlds. It is all pure speculation, depending upon our
ideas as to what the universe is for, as to what <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">we</span> think
(some of us!) <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">ought</span> to be! That is not evidence, even of
the flimsiest. All I maintain is that mine <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">is</span> evidence,
founded on physical probabilities, and that, as against no
evidence at all‚Äîno proved physical probability‚Äîmine holds
the field!‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

Canals," and am now writing an article, or perhaps a
small book, about it. I am sure his theories are all wrong,
and I am showing why, so that anyone can see his fallacies.
His observations, drawings, photographs, etc., are all quite
right, and I believe true to nature, but his interpretation of
what he sees is wrong‚Äîoften even to absurdity. He began
by thinking the straight lines are works of art, and as he
finds more and more of these straight lines, he thinks that
proves more completely that they are works of art, and then
he twists all other evidence to suit that. The book is not
very well written, but no doubt the newspaper men think
that as he is such a great astronomer he must know what

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Old Orchard, Broadstone, Dorset. October 9, 1913.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir Oliver Lodge,‚ÄîOwing to ill-health and other
causes I have only now been able to finish the perusal
of your intensely interesting and instructive Address to
the British Association. I cannot, however, refrain from
writing to you to express my admiration of it, and
especially of the first half of it, in which you discuss the
almost infinite variety and complexity of the physical
problems involved in the great principle of "continuity"
in so clear a manner that outsiders like myself are
able to some extent to apprehend them. I am especially
pleased to find that you uphold the actual existence and
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">continuity</span> of the ether as scientifically established,
and reject the doubts of some mathematicians as to
the reality and perfect continuity of space and time as
unthinkable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The latter part of the Address is even more important,
and is especially notable for your clear and positive statements
as to the evidence in all life-process of a "guiding"
Mind. I can hardly suppose that you can have found time
to read my rather discursive and laboured volume on "The
<span class="tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span>
<a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
World of Life," written mainly for the purpose of enforcing
not only the proofs of a "guiding" but also of a "foreseeing"
and "designing" Mind by evidence which will be
thought by most men of science to be unduly strained. It
is, therefore, the more interesting to me to find that you
have yourself (on pp. 33-34 of your Address) used the very
same form of analogical illustration as I have done (at
p. 296 of "The World of Life") under the heading of "A
Physiological Allegory," as being a very close representation
of what really occurs in nature.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To conclude: your last paragraph rises to a height of
grandeur and eloquence to which I cannot attain, but
which excites my highest admiration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Should you have a separate copy to spare of your Romanes

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir Oliver Lodge,‚ÄîMany thanks for your Romanes
Lecture, which, owing to my ignorance of modern electrical
theory and experiments, is more difficult for me than was
your British Association Address.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I have been very much interested the last month by
reading a book sent me from America by Mr. W.L. Webb,
being "An Account of the Unparalleled Discoveries of Mr.
T.J.J. See."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Several of Mr. See&#39;s own lectures are given, with references
to his "Researches on the Evolution of the Stellar
Systems," in two large volumes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">His theory of "capture" of suns, planets, and satellites
<span class="tei-pb" id="page180">[pg 180]</span>
<a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seems to me very beautifully worked out under the influence
of gravitation and a resisting medium of cosmical dust‚Äîwhich
explains the origin and motions of the moon as well
as that of all the planets and satellites far better than Sir
G. Darwin&#39;s expulsion theory.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I note however that he is quite ignorant that Proctor,
forty years ago, gave full reasons for this "capture"
theory in his "Expanse of Heaven," and also that the
same writer showed that the Milky Way could not have
the enormous lateral extension he gives to it, but that it
cannot really be much flattened. He does not even mention
the proofs given of this both by Proctor and, I think,
by Herbert Spencer, while in Mr. Webb&#39;s volume (opposite
p. 212) is a diagram showing the "Coal Sack" as a
"vacant lane" running quite through and across the
successive spiral extensions laterally of the galaxy, without
any reference or a word of explanation that such
features, of which there are many, really demonstrate the
untenability of such extension.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">An even more original and extremely interesting part
of Mr. See&#39;s work is his very satisfactory solution of the
hitherto unsolved geological problem of the origin of all
the great mountain ranges of the world, in Chapters X.,
XI., and XII. of Mr. Webb&#39;s volume. It seems quite
complete except for the beginnings, but I suppose it is a
result of the formation of the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">earth</span> by accretion and not
by expulsion, by heating and not by cooling....‚ÄîYours very truly,</p>

<h3 class="tei tei-head">II.‚ÄîSPIRITUALISM</h3>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">"The completely materialistic mind of my youth and early manhood has
been slowly moulded into the socialistic, spiritualistic, and theistic
mind I now exhibit‚Äîa mind which is, as my scientific friends think, so
weak and credulous in its declining years, as to believe that fruit and
flowers, domestic animals, glorious birds and insects, wool, cotton,
sugar and rubber, metals and gems, were all foreseen and foreordained
for the education and enjoyment of man. The whole cumulative argument of
my &#39;World of Life&#39; is that <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">in its every detail</span> it calls for the agency
of a mind ... enormously above and beyond any human mind ... Whether
this Unknown Reality is a single Being and acts everywhere in the
universe as direct creator, organiser, and director of every minutest
motion ... or through &#39;infinite grades of beings,&#39; as I suggest, comes
to much the same thing. Mine seems a more clear and intelligible
supposition ... and it is the teaching of the Bible, of Swedenborg, and
of Milton."‚ÄîLetter from A.R. Wallace to JAMES MARCHANT, written in
1913.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">The letters on Spiritualism which Wallace wrote cast
further light on the personal attitude of mind which
he maintained towards that subject. He was an unbiased
scientific investigator, commencing on the "lower
level" of spirit phenomena, such as raps and similar
physical manifestations of "force by unseen intelligences,"
and passing on to a clearer understanding of the phenomena
of mesmerism and telepathy; to the materialisation
of, and conversation with, the spirits of those who had
been known in the body, until the conviction of life after
death, as the inevitable crowning conclusion to the long
process of evolution, was reached in the remarkable chapter
with which he concludes "The World of Life"‚Äîan
impressive prose poem.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Like that of many other children, Wallace&#39;s early childhood
was spent in an orthodox religious atmosphere, which,
whilst awakening within him vague emotions of religious
<span class="tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span>
<a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fervour, derived chiefly from the more picturesque and impassioned
of the hymns which he occasionally heard sung
at a Nonconformist chapel, left no enduring impression.
Moreover, at the age of 14 he was brought suddenly into
close contact with Socialism as expounded by Robert Owen,
which dispelled whatever glimmerings of the Christian faith
there may have been latent in his mind, leaving him for
many years a confirmed materialist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This fact, together with his early-aroused sense of the
social injustice and privations imposed upon the poorer
classes both in town and country, which he carefully
observed during his experience as a land-surveyor, might
easily have had an undesirable effect upon his general
character had not his intense love and reverence for
nature provided a stimulus to his moral and spiritual development.
But the "directive Mind and Purpose" was
preparing him silently and unconsciously until his "fabric
of thought" was ready to receive spiritual impressions.
For, according to his own theory, as "the laws of nature
bring about continuous development, on the whole progressive,
one of the subsidiary results of this mode of development
is that no organ, no sensation, no faculty arises
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">before</span> it is needed, or in greater degree than it is needed."<a name="noteref_57" id="noteref_57"></a><a href="#note_57"><span class="footnoteref">57</span></a>
From this point of view we may make a brief outline of the
manner in which this particular "faculty" arose and was
developed in him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When at Leicester, in 1844, his curiosity was greatly excited
by some lectures on mesmerism given by Mr. Spencer
Hall, and he soon discovered that he himself had considerable
power in this direction, which he exercised on some of
his pupils.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Later, when his brother Herbert joined him in South
America, he found that he also possessed this gift, and on
<span class="tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span>
<a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
several occasions they mesmerised some of the natives for
mere amusement. But the subject was put aside, and
Wallace paid no further attention to such phenomena until
after his return to England in 1862.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was not until the summer of 1865 that he witnessed
any phenomena of a spiritualistic nature; of these a full
account is given in "Miracles and Modern Spiritualism"
(p. 132). "I came," he says, "to the inquiry utterly unbiased
by hopes or fears, because I knew that my belief
could not affect the reality, and with an ingrained prejudice
even against such a word as &#39;spirit,&#39; which I have
hardly yet overcome."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">From that time until 1895, when the second edition of
that book appeared, he did much, together with other
scientists, to establish these facts, as he believed them to
be, on a rational and scientific foundation. It will also
be noticed, both before and after this period, that in addition
to the notable book which he published dealing exclusively
with these matters, the gradual trend of his
convictions, advancing steadily towards the end which he
ultimately reached, had become so thoroughly woven into
his "fabric of thought" that it appears under many
phases in his writings, and occupies a considerable part
of his correspondence, of which we have only room for
some specimens.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The first definite statement of his belief in "this something"
other than material in the evolution of Man
appeared in his essay on "The Development of Human
Faces under the Law of Natural Selection" (1864). In
this he suggested that, Man having reached a state of
physical perfection through the progressive law of Natural
Selection, thenceforth Mind became the dominating factor,
endowing Man with an ever-increasing power of intelligence
which, whilst the physical had remained stationary, had
<span class="tei-pb" id="page184">[pg 184]</span>
<a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
continued to develop according to his needs. This "in-breathing"
of a divine Spirit, or the controlling force of
a supreme directive Mind and Purpose, which was one of
the points of divergence between his theory and that held
by Darwin, is too well known to need repetition.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This disagreement has a twofold interest from the fact
that Darwin, in his youth, studied theology with the full
intention of taking holy orders, and for some years retained
his faith in the more or less orthodox beliefs arising
out of the Bible. But as time went by, an ever-extending
knowledge of the mystery of the natural laws governing
the development of man and nature led him to make the
characteristically frank avowal that he "found it more
and more difficult ... to invent evidence which would
suffice to convince"; adding, "This disbelief crept over me
at a very slow rate, but was at last complete. The rate
was so slow that I felt no distress."<a name="noteref_58" id="noteref_58"></a><a href="#note_58"><span class="footnoteref">58</span></a> With Wallace, however,
his early disbelief ended in a deep conviction that
"as nothing in nature actually &#39;dies,&#39; but renews its life
in another and higher form, so Man, the highest product
of natural laws here, must by the power of mind and
intellect continue to develop hereafter."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The varied reasons leading up to this final conviction,
as related by himself in "Miracles and Modern Spiritualism"
and "My Life," are, however, too numerous and
detailed to be retold in a brief summary in this place.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The correspondence that follows deals entirely with investigations
on this side of the Atlantic, but a good deal of
evidence which to him was conclusive was obtained during
his stay in America, where Spiritualism has been more
widely recognised, and for a much longer period than in
England.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Some of the letters addressed to Miss Buckley (afterwards
<span class="tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span>
<a name="Pg185" id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mrs. Fisher) reveal the extreme caution which he
both practised himself and advocated in others when following
up any experimental phase of spiritual phenomena.
The same correspondence also gives a fairly clear outline
of his faith in the ascending scale from the physical
evidence of spirit-existence to the communication of some
actual knowledge of life as it exists beyond the veil.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In spiritual matters, as in natural science, though at
times his head may have appeared to be "in the clouds,"
his feet were planted firmly on the earth. This is seen,
to note another curious instance, in his correspondence
with Sir Wm. Barrett, where he maintains a delicate
balance between natural science and "spirit impression"
when discussing the much controverted reality of
"dowsing" for water.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It was this breadth of vision, unhampered by mere intellectualism,
but always kept within reasonable bounds by
scientific deduction and analysis, which constituted Alfred
Russel Wallace a seer of the first rank.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace lived to see the theory of evolution applied to
the life-history of the earth and the starry firmament, to
the development of nations and races, to the progress of
mind, morals and religion, even to the origin of consciousness
and life‚Äîa conception which has completely revolutionised
man&#39;s attitude towards himself and the world
and God. Evolution became intelligible in the light of
that idea which came to him in his hut at Ternate and
changed the face of the universe. Surely it was enough
for any one man to be one of the two chief originators of
such a far-reaching thought and to witness its impact upon
the ancient story of special creations which it finally laid
in the dust. But Wallace was privileged beyond all the
men of his generation. He lived to see many of the results
of the theory of evolution tested by time and to foresee that
<span class="tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span>
<a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
there were definite limits to its range, that, indeed, there
were two lines of development‚Äîone affecting the visible
world of form and colour and the other the invisible world
of life and spirit‚Äîtwo worlds springing from two opposite
poles of being and developing <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">pari passu</span>, or, rather, the
spiritual dominating the material, life originating and controlling
organisation. It was, in short, his peculiar task
to reveal something of the Why as well as the How of the
evolutionary process, and in doing so verily to bring immortality
to light.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The immediate exciting cause of this discovery of the
inadequacy of evolution from the material side alone to
account for the world of life may seem to many to have
been trivial and unworthy of the serious attention of a
great scientist. How, it might be asked, could the crude
and doubtful phenomena of Spiritualism afford reasonably
adequate grounds for challenging its supremacy and for
setting a limit to its range? But spiritualistic phenomena
were only the accidental modes in which the other side of
evolution struck in upon his vision. They set him upon the
other track and opened up to him the vaster kingdom of life
which is without beginning, limit or end; in which perchance
the sequence of life from the simple to the complex, from
living germ to living God, may also be the law of growth.
It is in the light of this ultimate end that we must judge
the stumbling steps guided by raps and visions which led
him to the ladder set up to the stars by which connection
was established with the inner reality of being. That was
the distinctive contribution which he made to human beliefs
over and above his advocacy of pure Darwinism.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Reading almost everything he could obtain upon occult
phenomena, Wallace found that there was such a mass of
testimony by men of the highest character and ability in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span>
<a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
every department of human learning that he thought it
would be useful to bring this together in a connected
sketch of the whole subject. This he did, and sent it to
a secularist magazine, in which it appeared in 1866, under
the title of "The Scientific Aspect of the Supernatural."
He sent a copy to Huxley.</p>

Hardinge<a name="noteref_59" id="noteref_59"></a><a href="#note_59"><span class="footnoteref">59</span></a> on very favourable topics, and I hope you will
hear her often again, and especially hear one of her
regular discourses. I think, however, from what you
heard, that, setting aside all idea of her being more than
a mere spiritualist lecturer setting forth the ideas and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span>
<a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opinions of the sect, you will admit that spiritualists,
as represented by her, are neither prejudiced nor unreasonable,
and that they are truly imbued with the
scientific spirit of subordinating all theory to fact. You
will also admit, I think, that the moral teachings of Spiritualism,
as far as she touched upon them, are elevated and
beautiful and calculated to do good; and if so, that is the
use of Spiritualism‚Äîthe getting such doctrines of future
progress founded on actual phenomena which we can
observe and examine now, not on phenomena which are
said to have occurred thousands of years ago and of which
we have confessedly but imperfect records.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I think, too, that the becoming acquainted with two such
phases of Spiritualism as are exhibited by Mrs. Hardinge

not to be judged by the common phenomena of public stances

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Miss Buckley,‚Äî ... I have lately had a stance
with the celebrated Mr. Home, and saw that most wonderful
phenomenon an accordion playing beautiful music by
itself, the bottom only being held in Mr. Home&#39;s hand. I
was invited to watch it as closely as I pleased under the
table in a well-lighted room. I am sure nothing touched
it but Mr. Home&#39;s one hand, yet at one time I saw a
shadowy yet defined hand on the keys. This is too vast a
phenomenon for any sceptic to assimilate, and I can well
understand the impossibility of their accepting the evidence
of their own senses. Mr. Crookes, F.R.S., the chemist, was
present and suspended the table with a spring balance, when
<span class="tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span>
<a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it was at request made heavy or light, the indicator moving
accordingly, and to prevent any mistake it was made light
when the hands of all present were resting on the table and
heavy when our hands were all underneath it. The difference,
if I remember, was about 40 lb. I was also asked to
place a candle on the floor and look under the table while
it was lifted completely off the floor, Mr. Home&#39;s feet being
2 ft. distant from any part of it. This was in a lady&#39;s
house in the West End. Mr. Home courts examination if
people come to him in a fair and candid spirit of inquiry....‚ÄîYours

Pray keep accurate notes of all that takes place.... Allow
me ... to warn you not to take it for granted till you get
proof upon proof that it is really your sister that is communicating
with you. I hope and think it is, but still, the
conditions that render communication possible are so subtle
and complex that she may not be able; and some other being,
reading your mind, may be acting through you and making
you think it is your sister, to induce you to go on. Be therefore
on the look out for characteristic traits of your sister&#39;s
mind and manner which are different from your own. These
will be tests, especially if they come when and how you are
not expecting them. Even if it is your sister, she may be
obliged to use the intermediation of some other being, and
in that case her peculiar idiosyncrasy may be at first disguised,
but it will soon make itself distinctly visible. Of
course you will preserve every scrap you write, and date
them, and they will, I have no doubt, explain each other as
you go on.

her to talk‚Äîwill not say what you expect her to say, is
a grand proof that it is not your unconscious cerebration

it is she herself or someone else who is talking to you,

enough.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Miss Buckley,‚ÄîOur stance came off last evening,
and was a tolerable success. The medium is a very pretty
little lively girl, the place where she sits a bare empty cupboard
formed by a frame and doors to close up a recess by
the side of a fireplace in a small basement breakfast-room.
We examined it, and it is absolutely impossible to conceal
a scrap of paper in it. Miss Cooke is locked in this cupboard,
above the door of which is a square opening about
15 inches each way, the only thing she takes with her being
a long piece of tape and a chair to sit on. After a few
minutes Katie&#39;s whispering voice was heard, and a little
while after we were asked to open the door and seal up
the medium. We found her hands tied together with the
tape passed three times round each wrist and tightly
knotted, the hands tied close together, the tape then passing
behind and well knotted to the chair-back. We sealed
all the knots with a private seal of my friend&#39;s, and again
locked the door. A portable gas lamp was on a table the
whole evening, shaded by a screen so as to cast a shadow
on the square opening above the door of the cupboard till
permission was given to illuminate it. Every object and
person in the room were always distinctly visible. A face<a name="noteref_60" id="noteref_60"></a><a href="#note_60"><span class="footnoteref">60</span></a>
then appeared at the opening, but dark and indistinct.</p>
<span class="tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span>
<a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p">After a time another face quite distinct with a white
turban-like headdress‚Äîthis was a handsome face with a
considerable general likeness to that of the medium, but
paler, larger, fuller, and older‚Äîdecidedly a different face,
although like. The light was thrown full on this face,
and on request it advanced so that the chin projected a
little beyond the aperture. We were then ordered to
release the medium. I opened the door, and found her
bent forward with her head in her lap, and apparently in
a deep sleep or trance‚Äîfrom which a touch and a few
words awoke her. We then examined the tape and knots‚Äîall
was as we left it and every seal perfect.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The same face appeared later in the evening, and also
one decidedly different with coarser features.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">After this, for the sake I believe of two sceptics present,
the medium was twice tied up in a way that no human
being could possibly tie herself. Her wrists were tied
together so tightly and painfully that it was impossible to
untie them in any moderate time, and she was also secured
to the chair; on the other occasion the two arms were tied
close above the elbows so tightly that the arms were swelling
considerably from impeded circulation, the elbows being
drawn together as close as possible behind the back, there
repeatedly knotted, and again tightly knotted to the back
of the chair. Miss C. was evidently in considerable pain,
and she had to be lifted out bodily in her chair before we
could safely cut her loose, so tightly was she bound. This
evidently had a great effect on the sceptics, as I have no
doubt it was intended to have, and it demonstrated pretty
clearly that some strange being was inside the cupboard
playing these tricks, although quite invisible and intangible
to us except when she made certain portions of herself
visible.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Miss C. was complaining of being hurt by the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span>
<a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tying we could hear the whispering voice soothing her in
the kindest manner, and also heard kisses, and Miss C.
afterwards declared that she could feel hands and face
about her like those of a real person.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">During all the face exhibitions singing had to go on to
a rather painful extent.<a name="noteref_61" id="noteref_61"></a><a href="#note_61"><span class="footnoteref">61</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A Dr. Purdon was present, an Army surgeon, who has
been much in India, and seems a very intelligent man. He
seemed very intimate with the family, and told us he had
studied them all, and had had Miss Cooke a month at a
time in his own house, studying these phenomena. He was
absolutely satisfied of their genuineness, and indeed no
opportunity for imposture seems to exist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The children of the house tell wonderful tales of how
they are lifted up and carried about by the spirits. They
seem to enjoy it very much, and to look upon it all as
just as real and natural as any other matters of their
daily life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Can such things be in this nineteenth century, and the
wise ones pass away in utter ignorance of their existence?‚ÄîYours

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">At the Glasgow Meeting of the British Association in
1876, Prof. (now Sir) W.F. Barrett read a paper "On
some Phenomena associated with Abnormal Conditions of
Mind." Wallace was Chairman of the Section in which
the paper was read, and a vigorous controversy arose at
the close between Dr. Carpenter, who came in towards
the end of the paper, and the Chairman. The paper set
forth certain remarkable evidence which Prof. Barrett had
obtained from a subject in the mesmeric trance, giving
what appeared to be indubitable proof of some supernormal
mode of transmission of ideas from his mind to
that of the subject. The facts were so novel and startling
that Prof. Barrett asked for a committee of experts to
<span class="tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span>
<a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
examine the whole question and see whether such a thing
as "thought transference," independently of the recognised
channels of sense, did really exist. This was the first time
evidence of this kind had been brought before a scientific
society, and a protracted discussion followed. The paper
also dealt with certain so-called spiritualistic phenomena,
which at the time Prof. Barrett was disposed to attribute
to hallucination and "thought-transference." The
introduction of this topic led the discussion away from
the substance of the paper, and Prof. Barrett&#39;s plea
for a committee of investigation on thought-transference
fell through. So strong was the feeling against the
paper in official scientific circles at the time, that even
an abstract was refused publication in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Report</span> of
the British Association, and it was not until the Society
for Psychical Research was founded that the paper was
published, in the first volume of its <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Proceedings</span>. It was
the need of a scientific society to collect, sift and discuss
and publish the evidence on behalf of such supernormal
phenomena as Prof. Barrett described at the British Association
that induced him to call a conference in London at
the close of 1881, which led to the foundation of the Society
for Psychical Research early in 1882.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace, in his letter to Prof. Barrett which follows,
refers to Reichenbach&#39;s experiments with certain sensitives
who declared they saw luminosity from the poles of
a magnet after they had been for some time in a perfectly
darkened room. Acting on Wallace&#39;s suggestion, Prof.
Barrett constructed a perfectly darkened room and employed
a large electro-magnet, the current for which
could be made or broken by an assistant outside without
the knowledge of those present in the darkened room.
Under these circumstances, and taking every precaution to
prevent any knowledge of when the magnet was made
active by the current, Prof. Barrett found that two or
three persons, out of a large number with whom he experimented,
saw a luminosity streaming from the poles of
the magnet directly the current was put on. An article
of Prof. Barrett&#39;s on the subject, with the details of the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span>
<a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
experiment, was published in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Philosophical Magazine</span>,
and also in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Proceedings</span> of the Society for Psychical

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Prof. Barrett,‚Äî ... I see you are to lecture
at South Kensington the end of this month (I think), and
if you can spare time to run down here and stay a night
or two we shall be much pleased to see you, and I shall
be greatly interested to have a talk on the subject of your
paper, and hear what further evidence you have obtained.
I want particularly to ask you to take advantage of any
opportunity that you may have to test the power of sensitives
to see the "flames" from magnets and crystals, as
also to <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">feel</span> the influence from them. This is surely a matter
easily tested and settled. I consider it has been tested and
settled by Reichenbach, but he is ignored, and a fresh proof
of this one fact, by indisputable tests, is much needed; and
a paper describing such tests and proofs would I imagine be
admitted into the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Proceedings</span> of any suitable society.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">You will have heard no doubt of the Treasury having
taken up the prosecution of Slade. Massey the barrister,
one of the most intelligent and able of the Spiritualists
(whose accession to the cause is due, I am glad to say, to
my article in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Fortnightly</span>), proposes a memorial and
deputation to the Government protesting against this prosecution
by the Treasury on the ground that it implies that
Slade is an habitual impostor and nothing else, and that
in face of the body of evidence to the contrary, it is an uncalled-for
interference with the private right of investigation
into these subjects. On such general grounds as these I
sincerely hope you will give your name to the memorial....‚ÄîYours

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Barrett,‚ÄîI am always glad when a man I like
and respect treats me as a friend. I am advised by other
friends also not to waste more time on Dr. C. [Carpenter],
and I do not think I shall answer him again, except perhaps
to keep him to certain points, as in my letter in the last
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nature</span>. In a proof of his new edition of "Lectures" I
see he challenges me to produce a person who can detect
by light or sensation when an electro-magnet is made and
unmade. The Association of Spiritualists are going to experiment,
as Dr. C. offers to pay ¬£30 if it succeeds. Should
you have an opportunity of trying with any persons, and
can find one who sees or feels the influence strongly, it might
be worth while to send him to London, as nothing would tend
to lower Dr. C. in public estimation on this subject more than
his being forced to acknowledge that what he has for more
than thirty years declared to be purely subjective is after
all an objective phenomenon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I never had anything to do with showing or sending a
medium to Huxley. He must refer to his s√©ance a few
months ago with Mrs. Kane and Mrs. Jencken (along with
Carpenter and Tyndall), when ... nothing but raps occurred....‚ÄîYours

<p class="tei tei-p">The British Association met in Dublin in 1878, and Prof.
Barrett asked Wallace to stay with him at Kingstown, or,
if he preferred being nearer the meetings, with a friend in
Dublin. Earlier in the year Mr. Huggins, afterwards Sir
W. Huggins, O.M. and President of the Royal Society, had
sent Prof. Barrett a very beautifully executed drawing of
the knots tied in an endless cord during the remarkable
sittings Prof. Z√∂llner had with the medium Slade. Sir
W. Huggins invited Prof. Barrett to come and see him at
<span class="tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span>
<a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his observatory at Tulse Hill, near London, and there he
met Wallace and discussed the whole matter. It may not
be generally known that so careful and accurate an
observer as Sir W. Huggins was convinced of the genuineness
of the phenomena he had witnessed with Lord Dunraven
and others through the medium D.D. Home. He
informed Prof. Barrett of this himself.</p>

Meeting of the British Association, which took place
in the London <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Times</span> and other newspapers, instances of
apparent thought-transference were given by many correspondents.
Each of these cases Prof. Barrett investigated
personally, and one of them led to a remarkable series of
experiments which he conducted at Buxton, with the result
that no doubt was left on his mind of the fact of the transference
of ideas from one mind to another independent
of the ordinary channels of sense. He asked Prof. and
Mrs. H. Sidgwick to come to Buxton and repeat his experiments
with the subjects there‚Äîdaughters of a local
clergyman. They did so, and though they had less success
<span class="tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span>
<a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at first than Prof. Barrett had had, they were ultimately
convinced of the genuineness of the phenomena. In addition,
Mr. Edmund Gurney, Mr. Frederic Myers, Prof. A.
Hopkinson and Prof. Balfour Stewart, all responded to
Prof. Barrett&#39;s invitation to visit Buxton and test the
matter for themselves, and all came to the same conclusion
as he had. Subsequently Gurney and Myers associated
their name with Barrett&#39;s in a paper on the subject,
published in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nineteenth Century</span>.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Prof. Barrett asked Wallace to read over the first
report made by Prof. and Mrs. Sidgwick, which at first
seemed somewhat disheartening, and the following is his
reply:</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<a name="toc_172" id="toc_172"></a>
<h3 class="tei tei-head">REMARKS ON EXPERIMENTS IN THOUGHT READING BY
MR. AND MRS. SIDGWICK AT BUXTON</h3>

<p class="tei tei-p">The failure of so many of these experiments seems to
me to depend on their having been conducted without any
knowledge of the main peculiarity of thought reading or
clairvoyance‚Äîthat it is a perception of the object thought
of or hidden, not by its name, or even by its sum total of
distinctive qualities, but by the simple qualities separately.
A clairvoyant will perceive a thing as round, then as yellow,
and finally as an orange. Now Mr. Galton&#39;s experiments
have shown how various are the powers of visualising objects
possessed by different persons, and how distinct their modes
of doing so; and if these distinct visualisations of the same
thing are in any way presented to a clairvoyant, there is
little wonder that some confusion should result. This would
suggest that one person who possesses the faculty of clearly
visualising objects would meet with more success than a
number of persons some of whom visualise one portion or
quality of the object, some another, while to others the name
alone is present to the mind. It follows from these considerations
that cards are bad for such experiments. The qualities
of number, colour, form and arrangement may be severally
<span class="tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span>
<a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
most prominent in one mind or other, and the result is confusion
to the thought reader. This is shown in the experiments
by the number of pips or the suit alone being often
right.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It must also be remembered that children have not the
same thorough knowledge of the names of the cards that
we have, nor can they so rapidly and certainly count their
numbers. This introduces another source of uncertainty
which should be avoided in such experiments as these.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The same thing is still more clearly shown by the way
in which objects are guessed by some prominent quality
or resemblance, not by any likeness of name‚Äîas poker
guessed for walking-stick, fork for pipe, something iron
for knife, etc. And the total failure in the case of names
of towns is clearly explained by the fact that these would
convey no distinct idea or concrete image that could be
easily described. These last failures really give an important
clue to the nature of the faculty that is being investigated,
since they show that it is not <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">words</span> or <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">names</span> that
are read but thoughts or images that are perceived, and
the certainty of the perception will depend upon the simple
character of these images and the clearness and identity of
the perception of them by the different persons present.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If these considerations are always kept in view, I feel
sure that the experiments will be far more successful.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace&#39;s remarkable gifts as a lecturer are less widely
known than his lucid and admirable style as a writer.
Though Sir Wm. Barrett has heard a great number of eminent
scientific men lecture, he considers that few could approach
him for the simplicity, clearness and vigour of his exposition,
which commanded the unflagging attention of every
one of his hearers. Mr. Frederic Myers, no mean judge
<span class="tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span>
<a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of literary merit, once said he thought Wallace one of the
most lucid English writers and lecturers of his time. Prof.
Barrett was anxious to induce Wallace to lecture in Dublin,
and brought the matter before the Science Committee of the
Royal Dublin Society, which arranges a course of afternoon
lectures by distinguished men every spring. The Committee
cordially supported the suggestion that Wallace should be
invited to lecture, and the invitation was accepted. During
his visit to Dublin, Wallace stayed with Prof. Barrett at
Kingstown, and was busily engaged in revising the proof-sheets
of his book on "Land Nationalisation" (1882).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In "My Life" (Vol. II., p. 334) Wallace says that
among the eminent men whose "first acquaintance and
valued friendship" he owed to a common interest in
Spiritualism was Frederic Myers, whom he met first at
some s√©ances in London about the year 1878.</p>

almost the only book which I could read was your "Malay

of my complete ignorance of natural history there was a
certain charm about the book, both moral and literary,
which made it deeply congenial in those trying hours. You

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1891, at the urgent request of Prof. H. Sidgwick,
President of the Society for Psychical Research, Prof.
Barrett undertook, with considerable reluctance, to make
a thorough examination of the subject of "dowsing" for
water and minerals by means of the so-called "divining
rod." At the time he fully believed that a critical inquiry
of this kind would speedily show all the alleged successes
of the dowser to be due either to fraud or a sharp eye for
the ground. As the inquiry went on, to his surprise he
found that neither chicanery, nor clever guessing, nor local
knowledge, nor chance coincidence could explain away the
accumulated evidence, but that something new to science
was really at the root of the matter. This result was so
startling that Prof. Barrett had to pursue the investigation
for six years before venturing to publish his first
report, which appeared in the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Proceedings</span> of the Society
for Psychical Research, Part xxxii., 1897. This was followed
by a second report published some years later, in
which he gave a fresh body of evidence on the criticisms
of some eminent geologists to whom he had submitted the
evidence. The reports were reviewed in <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nature</span> with
<span class="tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span>
<a name="Pg206" id="Pg206" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
considerable severity, and some erroneous statements were
made, to which Prof. Barrett replied. The editor, Sir
Norman Lockyer, at first declined to publish Prof. Barrett&#39;s
reply, and to this Wallace refers in the following letter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Barrett,‚Äî ... Apropos of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nature</span>, they never
gave a word of notice to my book<a name="noteref_64" id="noteref_64"></a><a href="#note_64"><span class="footnoteref">64</span></a>‚Äîprobably they would
say out of kindness to myself as one of their oldest contributors,
since they would have had to scarify me, especially
as regards the huge Vaccination chapter, which is nevertheless
about the most demonstrative bit of work I have done.
I begged Myers‚Äîas a personal favour‚Äîto read it. He told
me he firmly believed in vaccination, but would do so, and
afterwards wrote me that he could see no answer to it, and
if there was none he was converted. There certainly has
been not a tittle of answer except abuse.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I am glad you brought Lockyer up sharp in his attempt

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Parkstone, Dorset. December 24, 1900.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Barrett,‚Äî ... I have read your very interesting
paper on the divining rod, and the additional evidence
you now send. Of course, I think it absolutely conclusive,
but there are many points on which I differ from your conclusions
and remarks, which I think are often unfair to the
dowsers.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span>
<a name="Pg207" id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I will just refer to one or two. At p. 176 (note) you call
the idea of there being a "spring-head" at a particular point
"absurd." But instead of being absurd it is a <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">fact</span>, proved
not only by numerous cases you have given of strong springs
being found quite near to weak springs a few yards off, but
by all the phenomena of mineral and hot springs. Near
together, as at Bath, hot springs and cold springs rise to
the surface, and springs of different quality at Harrogate,
yet each keeps its distinct character, showing that each rises
from a great depth without any lateral diffusion or intermixture.
This is a common phenomenon all over the world,
the dowsers&#39; facts support it, geologists know all about
it, yet I presume they have told you that when a dowser
states this fact it ceases to be a fact and becomes an
absurdity!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The only other point I have time to notice is your Sect.
II. (p. 285). You head this, "Evidence that the Motion
of the Rod is due to Unconscious Muscular Action."
Naturally I read this with the greatest interest, but found
to my astonishment that you adduce no evidence at all, but
only opinions of various people, and positive assertions that
such is the case! Now as I <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">know</span> that motions of various
objects occur without any muscular action, or even any contact
whatever, while Crookes has proved this by careful experiments
which have never been refuted, what <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">improbability</span>
is there that this should be such a case, and what is the value
of these positive assertions which you quote as "evidence"?
And at p. 286 you quote the person who says the more he
tried to prevent the stick&#39;s turning the more it turned, as
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">evidence</span> in favour of muscular action, without a word of
explanation. Another man (p. 287) says he "could not restrain
it." None of the "trained anatomists" you quote
give a particle of <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">proof</span>, only positive opinion, that it must
be muscular action‚Äîsimply because they do not believe any
<span class="tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span>
<a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other action possible. Their evidence is just as valueless as
that of the people who say that all thought-transference is
collusion or imposture!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I do not say that it is not "muscular action," though
I believe it is not always so, but I do say that you have
as yet given not a particle of proof that it is so, while
scattered through your paper is plenty of evidence which
points to its being something quite different. Such are
the cases when people hold the rod for the first time and
have never seen a dowser work, yet the rod turns, over
water, to their great astonishment, etc. etc.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Your conclusion that it is "clairvoyance" is a good
provisional conclusion, but till we know what clairvoyance
really is it explains nothing, and is merely another
way of stating the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">fact</span>.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I believe all true clairvoyance to be spirit impression,
and that all true dowsing is the same‚Äîthat is,
when in either case it cannot be thought-transference,
but even this I believe to be also, for the most part, if
not wholly, spirit impression.‚ÄîBelieve me yours very
truly,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Sir,‚ÄîI know nothing of London mediums now.
Nine-tenths of the alleged frauds in mediums arise from
the ignorance of the sitters. The only way to gain any real
knowledge of spiritualistic phenomena is to follow the course
pursued in all science‚Äîstudy the elements before going to
the higher branches. To expect proof of materialisation
before being satisfied of the reality of such simpler phenomena
as raps, movements of various objects, etc. etc., is
as if a person began chemistry by trying to analyse the
more complex vegetable products before he knew the composition
of water and the simplest salts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">If you want to <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">know</span> anything about Spiritualism you
should experiment yourself with a select party of earnest
inquirers‚Äîpersonal friends. When you have thus satisfied
yourself of the existence of a considerable range of the
physical phenomena and of many of the obscurities and
difficulties of the inquiry, you may use the services of
public mediums, without the certainty of imputing every
little apparent suspicious circumstance to trickery, since
you will have seen similar suspicious facts in your private
circle where you <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">knew</span> there was no trickery. You will

<a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
next year. I maintain that as a matter of duty to the

of course it would be impossible for you to be much more
than an Honorary President, as we could not expect you
often to come to London. I am anxious that in our records
for future reference your Presidency should appear....
Podmore, who is proposed as President, represents the
attitude of resolute incredulity, and I consider this line
of action has been to some extent injurious to the S.P.R.
Crookes supported my proposal, and so did Lodge, and so
would Myers if he had lived. All this is of course between

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Barrett,‚ÄîI wrote you yesterday on quite
another matter, but having yours this morning in reply to
my criticisms of your Address, I send a few lines of explanation.
Most of my queries to your statements apply
solely to your expressing them so positively, as if they were
absolute certainties which no psychical researcher doubted.
My main objection to the term "subliminal self" and its
various synonyms is, that it is so dreadfully vague, and is
an excuse for the assumption that a whole series of the
most mysterious of psychical phenomena are held to be
actually explained by it. Thus it is applied to explain
all cases of apparent "possession," when the alleged
"secondary self" has a totally different character, and
uses the dialect of another social grade, from the normal
self, sometimes even possesses knowledge that the real
self could not have acquired, speaks a language that the
normal self never learnt. All this is, to me, the most
gross travesty of science, and I therefore object totally
to the use of the term which is so vaguely and absurdly
used, and of which no clear and rational explanation has
ever been given.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Addison somewhere says that modesty sets off every
talent which a man can be possessed of. This was
manifestly true of Alfred Russel Wallace. When,
for instance, honours were bestowed upon him, he accepted
or rejected them with the same good-humour and unspoilable
modesty. To Prof. E.B. Poulton, whose invitation
for the forthcoming Enc√¶mia had been conveyed in Prof.
Bartholomew Price&#39;s letter, he wrote:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Poulton,‚ÄîI have just received from Prof.
B. Price the totally unexpected offer of the honorary
degree of D.C.L. at the coming Commemoration, and you
will probably be surprised and <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">disgusted</span> to hear that I
have declined it. I have to thank you for your kind offer
of hospitality during the ceremony, but the fact is, I have
at all times a profound distaste of all public ceremonials,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span>
<a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and at this particular time that distaste is stronger than
ever. I have never recovered from the severe illness I had
a year and a half ago, and it is in hopes of restoring my
health that I have let my cottage here and have taken
another at Parkstone, Dorset, into which I have arranged
to move on Midsummer Day. To add to my difficulties, I
have work at examination papers for the next two or three
weeks, and also a meeting (annual) of our Land Nationalisation
Society, so that the work of packing my books and
other things and looking after the plants which I have
to move from my garden will have to be done in a very
short time. Under these circumstances it would be almost
impossible for me to rush away to Oxford except under
absolute compulsion, and to do so would be to render a
ceremony which at any time would be a trial, a positive
punishment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Really the greatest kindness my friends can do me is
to leave me in peaceful obscurity, for I have lived so
secluded a life that I am more and more disinclined to
crowds of any kind. I had to submit to it in America,
but then I felt exceptionally well, whereas now I am
altogether weak and seedy and not at all up to fatigue or
excitement.‚ÄîYours very faithfully,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Mr. Poulton,‚ÄîI am exceedingly obliged by your
kind letters, and I will say at once that if the Council of
the University should again ask me to accept the degree,
to be conferred in the autumn, as you propose, I could
not possibly refuse it. At the same time I hope you will
not in any way urge it upon them, as I really feel myself
too much of an amateur in Natural History and altogether
too ignorant (I left school‚Äîa bad one‚Äîfinally, at fourteen)
to receive honours from a great University. But I will say
no more about that.‚ÄîYours very faithfully,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In due course he received the degree. "On that occasion,"
says Professor Poulton, "Wallace stayed with us,
and I was anxious to show him something of Oxford; but,
with all that there is to be seen, one subject alone absorbed
the whole of his interest‚Äîhe was intensely anxious to find
the rooms where Grant Allen had lived. He had received
from Grant Allen&#39;s father a manuscript poem giving a
picture of the ancient city dimly seen by midnight from an
undergraduate&#39;s rooms. With the help of Grant Allen&#39;s
college friends we were able to visit every house in which
he had lived, but were forced to conclude that the poem
was written in the rooms of a friend or from an imaginary
point of view."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Wallace,‚Äî ... When you were at Kew this
summer I took the liberty of saying that it would give
great pleasure to the Fellows of the Royal Society if you
would be willing to join their body. I understood you to
say that it would be agreeable to you. I now propose to
comply with the necessary formalities. But before doing
so it will be proper to ask for your formal consent. You
will then, as a matter of course, be included in the next

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Wallace,‚Äî ... I was very vexed to hear that
I had misunderstood your wishes about the Royal Society.
Of course, the matter must often have presented itself to
your mind, and I confess that it argued a little presumption
on the part of a person like myself, so far inferior to
you in age and standing, to think that you would yield to
my solicitation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I was obliged for my health to go to Eastbourne, and
there I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Huxley, who, you
will be glad to hear, is wonderfully well, and an ardent
gardener! His present ambition is to grow every possible
saxifrage.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I told him that I had had the audacity to approach you
on the subject of the Royal Society. He heartily approved,
and expressed the strongest opinion that unless you had
some insuperable objection you ought to yield. All of us
who belong to the R.S. have but one wish, which is that
it should stand before the public as containing all that is
best and worthiest in British Science. As long as men
like you stand aloof, that cannot be said. Lately we have
been exposed to some very ill-natured attacks: we have
been told that we are professional, and not discoverers.
Well, this is all the more reason for your not holding
aloof from us. I wish you would think it over
again. Huxley went the length of saying that to him it
seemed a plain duty. But this is language I do not like
to use.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As to attending the meetings or taking part in the work
of the Society, that is immaterial. Darwin never did either,
though he did once come to one of the evening receptions,
and enjoyed it immensely.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In writing as I do I am not merely expressing my own
opinions, but those of many others of my own standing
who are keenly interested in the matter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is not a great matter to ask. I have the certificate
ready. You have but to say the word. You will be put
<span class="tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span>
<a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to no trouble or pecuniary responsibility. That my father-in-law
arranged, long ago.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To dissociate yourself from the R.S. really amounts nowadays
to doing it an injury. And I am sure you do not wish
that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Thiselton-Dyer,‚ÄîI have been rather unwell
myself the last few days or should have answered your
very kind letter sooner. I feel really overpowered. I cannot
understand why you or anyone should care about my
being an F.R.S., because I have really done so little of
what is usually considered scientific work to deserve it. I
have for many years felt almost ashamed of the amount of
reputation and honour that has been awarded me. I can
understand the general public thinking too highly of me,
because I know that I have the power of clear exposition,
and, I think, also, of logical reasoning. But all the
work I have done is more or less amateurish and founded
almost wholly on other men&#39;s observations; and I always
feel myself dreadfully inferior to men like Sir J. Hooker,
Huxley, Flower, and scores of younger men who have extensive
knowledge of whole departments of biology of
which I am totally ignorant. I do not wish, however, to
be thought ungrateful for the many honours that have been
given me by the Royal and other Societies, and will therefore
place myself entirely in your hands as regards my
election to the F.R.S.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I am much pleased to hear that Huxley has taken to
gardening. I have no doubt he will do some good work
with his saxifrages. For myself the personal attention to
my plants occupies all my spare time, and I derive constant
enjoyment from the mere contemplation of the infinite
variety of forms of leaf and flower, and modes of
growth, and strange peculiarities of structure which are
the source of fresh puzzles and fresh delights year by year.

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">In 1902 the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Standard</span> announced that the degree of
D.C.L. was to be conferred upon him by the University of
Wales. He wrote to Miss Dora Best, who had sent him the
information:</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">I have not seen the <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Standard</span>. But I suppose it is about
the offer of a degree by the University of Wales. You will
not be surprised to hear that I have declined it "with
thanks." The bother, the ceremony, the having perhaps to
get a blue or yellow or scarlet gown! and at all events new
black clothes and a new topper! such as I have not worn
this twenty years. Luckily I had a good excuse in having
committed the same offence before. Some ten years back
I declined the offer of a degree from Cambridge, so that
settled it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">P.S.‚ÄîHaving already degrees two‚ÄîLL.D. (Dublin) and

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">In 1908 he received the Order of Merit, the highest honour
conferred upon him. To his friend Mrs. Fisher he wrote:</p>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mrs. Fisher,‚ÄîIs it not awful‚Äîtwo more now! I
should think very few men have had three such honours
within six months! I have never felt myself worthy of
the Copley Medal‚Äîand as to the Order of Merit‚Äîto be
given to a red-hot Radical, Land Nationaliser, Socialist,
Anti-Militarist, etc. etc. etc., is quite astounding and
unintelligible!...</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">There is another thing you have not heard yet, but it
will be announced soon. Sir W. Crookes, as Secretary of
the Royal Institution, wrote to me two weeks back asking
me very strongly to give them a lecture at their opening
meeting (third week in January) appropriate to the Jubilee
of the "Origin of Species." I was very unwell at the time‚Äîcould
<span class="tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span>
<a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eat nothing, etc.‚Äîand was going to decline positively,
having nothing more to say! But while lying down,
vaguely thinking about it, an idea flashed upon me of a
new treatment of the whole subject of Darwinism, just
suitable for a lecture to a R.I. audience. I felt at once
there was something that ought to be said, and that I
should like to say‚Äîso I actually wrote and accepted, provisionally.
My voice has so broken that unless I can
improve it I fear not being heard, but Crookes promised
to read it either wholly, or leaving to me the opening
and concluding paragraphs. I was very weak‚Äîalmost a
skeleton‚Äîbut I am now getting much better. But finishing
up the "Spruce" book, and now all these honours and
congratulations and letters, etc., are giving me much work,
yet I am getting strong again, and really hope to do this
"lecture" as my last stroke for Darwinism against the
Mutationists and Mendelians, but much more effective, I
hope, than my article in the August <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Contemporary Review</span>,

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Fred,‚Äî ... I received a letter from Lord
Knollys‚Äîthe King&#39;s Private Secretary‚Äîinforming me that
His Majesty proposed to offer me the Order of Merit,
among the Birthday honours! This is an "Order" established
by the present King about eight years ago, solely
for "merit"‚Äîwhether civil or military‚Äîit is a pity it
was not civil only, as the military have so many distinctions
already. So I had to compose a very polite letter
of acceptance and thanks, and then later I had to beg to
be excused (on the ground of age and delicate health)
from attending the investiture at Buckingham Palace (on
<span class="tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span>
<a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
December 14th), when Court dress‚Äîa kind of very costly
livery‚Äîis obligatory! and I was kept for weeks waiting.
But at last one of the King&#39;s Equerries, Col. Legge (an
Earl&#39;s son), came down here about two weeks ago bringing
the Order, which is a very handsome cross in red and
blue enamel and gold‚Äîrich colours‚Äîwith a crown above,
and a rich ribbed-silk blue and crimson riband to hang it
round the neck! Col. Legge was very pleasant, stayed
half an hour, had some tea, and showed us how to wear
it. So I shall be in duty bound to wear it on the only
public occasion I shall be seen again (in all probability),
when I give (or attempt to give) my lecture.<a name="noteref_66" id="noteref_66"></a><a href="#note_66"><span class="footnoteref">66</span></a> Then, I

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace regarded "Sunlight&#39;s" prophecy about "retrospection"
as being fulfilled in 1904, when he received the
invitation of Messrs. Chapman and Hall to begin collecting
material for his autobiography which was subsequently published
in two large volumes, under the title of "My Life."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Referring to this work he wrote to Mrs. Fisher:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mrs. Fisher,‚ÄîThanks for your remarks on what
an autobiography ought to be. But I am afraid I shall
fall dreadfully short. I seem to remember nothing but
ordinary facts and incidents of no interest to anyone but
my own family. I do not feel myself that anything has
much influenced my character or abilities, such as they
are. Lots of things have given me opportunities, and
those I can state. Also other things have directed me
into certain lines, but I can&#39;t dilate on these; and really,
with the exception of Darwin and Sir Charles Lyell, I
<span class="tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span>
<a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have come into close relations with hardly any eminent men.
All my doings and surroundings have been commonplace!</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I am now just reading a charming and ideal bit of autobiography‚ÄîRobert
Dale Owen&#39;s "Threading my Way." If
you have not read it, do get it (published by Tr√ºbner and
Co. in 1874). It is delightful. So simple and natural
throughout. But his father was one of the most wonderful
men of the nineteenth century‚ÄîRobert Owen of New
Lanark‚Äîand this book gives the true history of his great
success. Then R.D. Owen met Clarkson and heard from
his own lips how he worked to abolish the slave trade.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then he had part of his education at Hofwyl under
Fellenberg, an experiment in education and self-government
wonderfully original and successful. He afterwards
worked at "New Harmony" with his father, and met
during his life almost all the most remarkable people in
England and America.</p>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">He always thought that he was deficient in the gift of
humour: "I am," he wrote to Mr. J.W. Marshall (May
6, 1905), "still grinding away at my autobiography. Have
got to my American lecture tour, and hope to finish by
about Sept. but have such lots of interruptions. I am
just reading Huxley&#39;s Life. Some of his letters are inimitable,
but the whole is rather monotonous. I find there
is a good deal of variety in my life if I had but the gift of
humour! Alas! I could not make a joke to save my life.
But I find it very interesting." "Unless somebody," he
wrote to Miss Evans, "can make me laugh just before
the critical moment I always have a horrid expression in
photographs." Yet another observant friend remarked that
"he had a keen sense of humour. It was always his
boyish joyous exuberance which touched me. He never
grew old. When I had sat with him an hour he was a
young man, he became transfigured to me." ... "The last
time I saw Dr. Wallace," writes Prof. T.D.A. Cockerell
of Colorado, "was immediately after the Darwin Celebration
at Cambridge in 1909. I was the first to give him the
details concerning it, and vividly remember how interested
he was, and how heartily he laughed over some of the funny
incidents, which may not as yet be told in print. One of
his most prominent characteristics was his keen sense of
humour, and his enjoyment of a good story." In the summer
of 1885 he spent a holiday with Prof. Meldola at Lyme
Regis. "After our ramble," said the Professor, "we used
to spend the evenings indoors, I reading aloud the &#39;Ingoldsby
Legends,&#39; which Wallace richly enjoyed. His humour was
<span class="tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span>
<a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a delightful characteristic. &#39;The inimitable puns of T.
Hood were,&#39; he said, &#39;the delight of my youth, as is the
more recondite and fantastic humour of Mark Twain and
Lewis Carroll in my old age.&#39;"</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace loved to give time and trouble in aiding young
men to start in life, especially if they were endeavouring
to become naturalists. He sent them letters of advice,
helped them in the choice of the right country to visit,
and gave them minute practical instructions how to live
healthily and to maintain themselves. He put their needs
before other and more fortunate scientific workers and
besought assistance for them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"The central secret of his personal magnetism lay in
his wide and unselfish sympathy," writes Prof. Poulton.<a name="noteref_67" id="noteref_67"></a><a href="#note_67"><span class="footnoteref">67</span></a>
"It might be thought by those who did not know Wallace
that the noble generosity which will always stand as an
example before the world was something special‚Äîcalled forth
by the illustrious man with whom he was brought in contact.
This would be a great mistake. Wallace&#39;s attitude was
characteristic, and characteristic to the end of his life.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"A keen young naturalist in the North of England, taking
part in an excursion to the New Forest, called on Wallace
and confided to him the dream of his life‚Äîa first-hand knowledge
of tropical nature. When I visited &#39;Old Orchard&#39; in
the summer of 1903, I found that Wallace was intently
interested in two things: his garden, and the means by
which his young friend&#39;s dream might best be realised.
The subject was referred to in seventeen letters to me; it
formed the sole topic of some of them. It was a grand
and inspiring thing to see this great man identifying himself
heart and soul with the interests of one‚Äîtill then a
stranger‚Äîin whom he recognised the passionate longings
<span class="tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span>
<a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his own youth. By the force of sympathy he re-lived
in the life of another the splendid years of early manhood."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">The late Prof. Knight recalled meeting him at the
British Association in Dundee, during the year 1867, when
Wallace was his guest for the usual time of the gathering.
He wrote:</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">I, and everyone else who then met him at my house,
were struck, as no one could fail to be, by his rare
urbanity, his social charm, his modesty, his unobtrusive
strength, his courtesy in explaining matters with which
he was himself familiar but those he conversed with
were not; and his abounding interest, not only in almost
every branch of Science, but in human knowledge in all
its phases, especially new ones. He was a many-sided
scientific man, and had a vivid sense of humour. He
greatly enjoyed anecdote, as illustrative of character.
During those days he talked much on the fundamental
relations between Science and Philosophy, as well as on
the connection of Poetry with both of them. When he
left Dundee he went to Kenmore, that he might ascend
Ben Lawers in search of some rare ferns.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In 1872 I saw him, after meeting Thomas Carlyle and
Dean Stanley at Linlathen, when Darwin&#39;s theory was
much discussed, and when our genial host‚ÄîMr. Erskine‚Äîtalked
so dispassionately but decidedly against evolution
as explanatory of the rise of what was new. A little
later in the same year Matthew Arnold discussed the same
subject with some friends at the Athen√¶um Club, defending
the chief aim of Darwin&#39;s theory, and enlarging from
a different point of view what Wallace had done in the
same direction. I remember well that he characterised
the two men as fellow-workers, not as followers, or in
any sense as copyists. Wallace&#39;s versatility not only continued,
but grew in many ways with the advance of years.
It was seen in his appreciation of the value of historical
study. Quite late in life he wrote: "The nineteenth century
is quite as wonderful in the domain of History as in
<span class="tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span>
<a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that of Science." Comparatively few know, or remember,
that he and his young brother Herbert‚Äîon whom he left
an interesting chapter <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">in memoriam</span>‚Äîboth wrote verses,
some of which were of real value.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It may be safely said that few scientific men have
sympathetically entered into bordering territories and
therein excelled. The whole field of psychical research
was familiar to him, and he might have been a leader
in it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My last meeting with him was at his final home, the
"Old Orchard," Broadstone, in 1909. I was staying at
Boscombe in Hants, and he asked me to "come and see
his garden, while we talked of past days." He had then
the freshness of boyhood, blent with the mellow wisdom
of age.‚ÄîW.A.K.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">The eminent naturalist and traveller, Dr. Henry O.
Forbes, who later explored the greater part of the lands
visited by Wallace, contributes the following appreciation
of the latter&#39;s scientific work:</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">As a traveller, explorer and working naturalist, Wallace
will always stand in the first rank, compared even with the
most modern explorers. It ought not to be forgotten, however,
how great were the difficulties, the dangers and the
cost of travel fifty years ago, compared with the facilities
now enjoyed by his successors, who can command steam
and motor transport to wellnigh any spot on the coasts of
the globe, and who have to their hand concentrated and
preserved foods, a surer knowledge of the causes of tropical
diseases, and outfits of non-perishable medicines sufficient
for many years within the space of a few cubic inches.
Commissariat and health are the keys to all exploration in
uncivilised regions. Wallace accomplished his work on the
shortest of commons and lay weeks at a time sick through
inability to replenish his medical stores.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was no mere "trudger" over new lands. Where
those before him, and even many after him, have been
able to see only sterile objects, his discerning eyes perceived
<span class="tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span>
<a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
everywhere a meaning in the varying modes of organic life,
and in response to his sympathetic mind Nature revealed to
him more of her multitudinous secrets than to most others.
Wallace&#39;s Amazonian travels were far from unfruitful, in
spite of the irreparable loss he sustained in the burning of
his notes and the bulk of his collections in the vessel by which
he was returning home; but it was in the Malay Archipelago
that his most celebrated years of investigation were passed,
which marked him as one of the greatest naturalists of our
time. As a methodical natural history collector‚Äîwhich is
"the best sport in the world" according to Darwin‚Äîhe has
never been surpassed; and few naturalists, if any, have ever
brought together more enormous collections than he. The
mere statement, taken from his "Malay Archipelago," of
the number of his captures in the Archipelago in six years
of actual collecting, exceeding 125,000 specimens‚Äîa number
greater than the entire contents of many large museums‚Äîstill
causes amazement. The value of a collection, however,
depends on the full and accurate information attached to
each specimen, and from this point of view only a few collections,
including Darwin&#39;s and Bates&#39;s, have possessed the
great scientific value of his.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace&#39;s Eastern explorations included nearly all the
large and the majority of the smaller islands of the Archipelago.
Many of them he was the first naturalist to visit,
or to reside on. Ceram, Batjian, Buru, Lombok, Timor,
Aru, Ke and New Guinea had never been previously
scientifically investigated. When in 1858 "the first and
greatest of the naturalists," as Dr. Wollaston styles Wallace,
visited New Guinea, it was "the first time that any
European had ventured to reside alone and practically unprotected
on the mainland of this country," which, dangerous
as it is now in the same regions, was infinitely more so
then. Of the journals of his voyagings, "The Malay Archipelago"
will always be ranked among the greatest narratives
of travel. The fact that this volume has gone through
a dozen editions is witness to its extraordinary popularity
among intelligent minds, and hardly supports the belief
that his scientific work has been forgotten. Nor can this
<span class="tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span>
<a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
popularity be a matter of much surprise, for few travellers
have possessed Wallace&#39;s powers of exposition, his lucidity
and charm of style. Professor Strasburger of Bonn has
declared that through "The Malay Archipelago" "a new
world of scientific knowledge" was unfolded before him.
"I feel it ... my duty," he adds, "to proclaim it with
gratitude." Wallace&#39;s narrative has attracted during the
past half-century numerous naturalists to follow in his
tracks, many of whom have reaped rich aftermaths of his
harvest; but certain it is that no explorer in the same, if
in any other, region has approached his eminence, or attained
the success he achieved.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">As a systematic zoologist, Wallace took no inconsiderable
place; his <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">m√©tier</span>, however, was different. He described,
nevertheless, large sections of his Lepidoptera and of his
birds, on which many valuable papers are printed in the
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Transactions</span> of the learned societies and in various scientific
periodicals. Of the former, special mention may be made
of that on variation in the "Papilionid√¶ of the Malayan
Region," of which Darwin has recorded: "I have never
in my life been more struck by any paper." Of the latter,
reference may be drawn to his account of the "Pigeons of
the Malay Archipelago" and his paper on the "Passerine
Birds," in which he proposed an important new arrangement
of the families of that group (used later in his
"Geographical Distribution") based on the feathering of
their wings. Without a lengthy search through the zoological
records, it would be impossible to say how many
species Wallace added to science; but the constant recurrence
in the Catalogue of Birds in the British Museum of
"wallacei" as the name bestowed on various new species
by other systematists, and of "Wallace" succeeding those
scientifically named by himself, is an excellent gauge of
their very large number.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">In the field of anthropology Wallace could never be an
uninterested spectator. He took a deep interest, he tells
us, in the study of the various races of mankind. His
accounts of the Amazonian tribes suffered greatly by the
loss of his journals; but of the peoples of the Malay
<span class="tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span>
<a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Archipelago he has given us a most interesting narrative,
detailing their bodily and mental characteristics, and showing
how their distribution accorded with that of the fauna
on the opposite sides‚ÄîMalays to the West, Papuans to the
East‚Äîof Wallace&#39;s Line. If fuller investigation of the
New Guinea tribes requires some modification in regard
to their origin, his observations, as broadly outlined then,
remain true still. His opinions on the origin of the Australian
aborigines‚Äîthat they were a low and primitive type
of Caucasian race‚Äîwhich, when first promulgated, were
somewhat sceptically received, are now those accepted by
many very competent anthropologists.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace&#39;s contributions to Geographical Science were
only second in importance to those he so pre-eminently
made to biology. Though skilled in the use of surveying
instruments, he did little or no map-making‚Äîat all times
a laborious and lengthy task‚Äîfor, with more important
purposes in his mind, he could not spare the time, nor did
the limitations to his movements permit any useful attempt.
Yet he did pure geographical work quite as important. The
value of the comparative study of the flora and fauna of
neighbouring regions, the great differences in the midst of
much likeness between the organic life of neighbouring land
masses, was a subject that was always in Wallace&#39;s mind
during his exploration of the Amazon Valley, for he perceived
that the physical geography and the distribution of
these animals and plants were of the greatest service in
elucidating their history where the geological record was
defective. As is well known, the visual inspection of the
geological structure of tropical countries is always difficult
and often impossible to make out because of the dense vegetation
upon the surface and even the faces of the river gorges.
But for the loss of his collections and notes we should have
had from Wallace&#39;s pen a Physical History of the Amazon.
This loss was, however, amply made up by his very original
contributions to the geography of the Malay Archipelago.
"The Zoological Geography of the Malay Archipelago" and
"The Physical Geography of the Malay Archipelago" (written
on Eastern soil, with the texts of his discourses around
<span class="tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span>
<a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him) were the forerunners of his monumental "Geographical
Distribution of Animals," elaborated in England after his
return. "To the publication of the &#39;Geographical Distribution
of Animals&#39; we owe the first scientific study of the
distribution of organic life on the globe, which has broadened
ever since, and continues to interest students daily; his brilliant
work in Natural History and Geography ... is universally
honoured," are the opinions of Dr. Scott speaking
as President of the Linnean Society of London.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">One of Wallace&#39;s most important contributions to the
physical geography of the Malay region was his discovery
of the physical differences between the western and the
eastern portions of the Archipelago; i.e. that the islands
lying to the east of a line running north from the middle
of the Straits of Bali and outside Celebes were fragments
of an ancient and larger Australian continent, while those
to the western side were fragments of an Asiatic continent.
This he elucidated by recognising that the flora and fauna
on the two sides of the line, close though these islands
approached each other, were absolutely different and had
remained for ages uncommingled. This line was denominated
"Wallace&#39;s Line" by Huxley, and this discovery
alone would have been sufficient to associate his name inseparably
with this region of the globe.‚ÄîH.O.F.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Like Darwin, Wallace gave excessive attention to the
suggestions and criticisms of people who were obviously
ignorant of the subjects about which they wrote. He was
never impatient with honest ignorance or considered the
lowly position of his correspondents. He replied to all
letters of inquiry (and he received many from working men),
and always gave his best knowledge and advice to anyone
who desired it. There was not the faintest suggestion of the
despicable sense of superiority about him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"I had, of course, revelled in &#39;The Malay Archipelago&#39;
when a boy," says Prof. Cockerell, "but my first personal
relations with Dr. Wallace arose from a letter I wrote him
<span class="tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span>
<a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after reading his &#39;Darwinism,&#39; then (early in 1890) recently
published. The book delighted me, but I found a number
of little matters to criticise and discuss, and with the impetuosity
of youth proceeded to write to the author, and
also to send a letter on some of the points to <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Nature</span>. I
have possibly not yet reached years of discretion, but in
the perspective of time I can see with confusion that what
I regarded as worthy zeal might well have been characterised
by others as confounded impudence. In the face of
this, the tolerance and kindness of Dr. Wallace&#39;s reply is
wholly characteristic: &#39;I am very much obliged to you for
your letter containing so many valuable emendations and
suggestions on my "Darwinism." They will be very useful
to me in preparing another edition. Living in the country
with but few books, I have often been unable to obtain the
<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">latest</span> information, but for the purpose of the argument
the facts of a few years back are often as good as those of
to-day‚Äîwhich in their turn will be modified a few years
hence.... You appear to have so much knowledge of
details in so many branches of natural history, and also
to have thought so much on many of the more recondite
problems, that I shall be much pleased to receive any
further remarks or corrections on any other portions of
my book.&#39; This letter, written to a very young and quite
unknown man in the wilds of Colorado, who had merely
communicated a list of more or less trifling criticisms, can
only be explained as an instance of Dr. Wallace&#39;s eagerness
to help and encourage beginners. It did not occur to
him to question the propriety of the criticisms, he did not
write as a superior to an inferior; he only saw what seemed
to him a spark of biological enthusiasm, which should by
all means be kindled into flame. Many years later, when
I was at his house, he produced with the greatest delight
some letters from a young man who had gone to South
<span class="tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span>
<a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
America and was getting his first glimpse of the tropical
forest. What discoveries he might make! What joy he
must have on seeing the things described in the letter, such
things as Dr. Wallace himself had seen in Brazil so long
ago!"</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace&#39;s critical faculty was always keen and vigilant.
Unlike some critics, however, he relished genuine and
well-informed criticism of his own writings. Flattery he
despised; whilst the charge of dishonesty aroused strongest
resentment. Deceived he might be, but he required clear
proof that his own eyes and ears had led him astray.
Romanes, who had propounded the forgotten theory of
physiological selection, charged Wallace with adopting it
as his own. This was not only untrue, it was ridiculous;
and Wallace, after telling him so and receiving no apology,
dropped him out of his recognition. During Romanes&#39; illness
Mr. Thiselton-Dyer wrote to Wallace and sought to
bring about a reconciliation, and Wallace replied:</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p"><span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">Parkstone, Dorset. September 26, 1893.</span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">My dear Thiselton-Dyer,‚ÄîI am sorry to hear of Romanes&#39;
illness, because I think he would have done much good work
in carrying out experiments which require the leisure, means
and knowledge which he possesses. I cannot, however, at
all understand his wishing to have any communication from
myself. I do not think I ever met Romanes in private more
than once, when he called on me more than twenty years
ago about some curious psychical phenomena occurring in
his own family; and perhaps half a dozen letters‚Äîif so
many‚Äîmay have passed between us since. There is therefore
no question of personal friendship disturbed. I consider,
however, that he made a very gross misstatement and
personal attack on me when he stated, both in English and
American periodicals, that in my "Darwinism" I adopted
his theory of "physiological selection" and claimed it as my
<span class="tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span>
<a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
own, and that my adoption of it was "unequivocal and
complete." This accusation he supported by such a flood
of words and quotations and explanations as to obscure
all the chief issues and render it almost impossible for the
ordinary reader to disentangle the facts. I told him then
that unless he withdrew this accusation as publicly as he
had made it I should decline all future correspondence
with him, and should avoid referring to him in any of my
writings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This is, of course, very different from any criticism of
my theories; that, or even ridicule, would never disturb
me; but when a man has made an accusation of literary
and scientific dishonesty, and has done all he can to
spread this accusation over the whole civilised world, my
only answer can be‚Äîafter showing, as I have done (<span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">see
Nature</span>, vol. xliii., pp. 79 and 150), that his accusations
are wholly untrue‚Äîto ignore his existence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I cannot believe that he can want any sympathy from
a man he says has wilfully and grossly plagiarised him,
unless he feels that his accusations were unfounded. If
he does so, and will write to me to that effect (for publication,
if I wish, after his death), I will accept it as full
reparation and write him such a letter as you suggest.‚ÄîBelieve
me yours very faithfully,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dear Mr. Wallace,‚ÄîI am afraid I have been rather guilty
of an impertinence which I hope you will forgive.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Romanes is an old acquaintance of mine of many years&#39;
standing. Personally, I like him very much; but for his
writings I confess I have no great admiration.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Pray believe me I had no mission of any sort on his
part to write to you. But I feel so sorry for him that
when he told me how much he regretted that he did not
stand well with you, I could not resist writing to tell you
of the calamities that have befallen him.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I must confess I was in total ignorance of what you
<span class="tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span>
<a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tell me. I don&#39;t see how, under the circumstances, you
can do anything. I was never more surprised in my life,
in fact, than when I read your letter. The whole thing is
too childishly preposterous.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Romanes laments over <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">me</span> because he says I wilfully misunderstand
his theory. The fact is, poor fellow, that I do
not think he understands it himself. If his life had been
destined to be prolonged I should have done all in my power
to have induced him to occupy himself more with observation
and less with mere logomachy.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">I cannot get him to face the fact that natural hybrids
are being found to be more and more common amongst
plants. At the beginning of the century it was supposed
that there were some sixty recognisable species of willows
in the British Isles: now they are cut down to about
sixteen, and all the rest are resolved into hybrids.‚ÄîEver
sincerely,</p>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">W.T. THISELTON-DYER.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace was a seeker after Truth who was never shy of his
august mistress, whatever robes she wore. "I feel within
me," wrote Darwin to Henslow, "an instinct for truth, or
knowledge, or discovery, of something of the same nature as
the instinct of virtue." This was equally true of Wallace.
He had a fine reverence for truth, beauty and love, and he
feared not to expose error. He paid no respect to time-honoured
practices and opinions if he believed them to be
false. Vaccination came under his searching criticism, and
in the face of nearly the whole medical faculty he denounced
it as quackery condemned by the very evidence used to defend
it. He very carefully examined the claims of phrenology,
which had been laughed out of court by scientific men, and
he came to the conclusion that "in the present (twentieth)
century phrenology will assuredly attain general acceptance.
It will prove itself to be the true science of the mind. Its
practical uses in education, in self-discipline, in the reformatory
treatment of criminals, and in the remedial
<span class="tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span>
<a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
treatment of the insane, will gain it one of the highest
places in the hierarchy of the sciences; and its persistent
neglect and obloquy during the last sixty years of the
nineteenth century will be referred to as an example of
the almost incredible narrowness and prejudice which prevailed
among men of science at the very time they were
making such splendid advances in other fields of thought
and discovery."<a name="noteref_68" id="noteref_68"></a><a href="#note_68"><span class="footnoteref">68</span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace was not even scared out of his wits by ghosts,
for, unlike Coleridge, he believed in them although he
thought he had seen many. Whether truth came from the
scaffold or the throne, the s√©ance or the sky, it did not alter
the truth, and did not prejudice or overbear his judgment.
He shed his early materialism (which temporarily took
possession of him as it did of many others as a result of
the shock following the overwhelming discoveries of that
period) when he was brought face to face with the phenomena
of the spiritual kingdom which withstood the searching
test of his keen observation and reasoning powers.
Prejudices, preconceived notions, respect for his scientific
position or the opinions of his eminent friends or the
reputation of the learned societies to which he belonged‚Äîall
were quietly and firmly put aside when he saw what
he recognised to be the truth. If his fellow-workers did
not accept it, so much the worse for them. He stood four-square
against the onslaught of quasi-scientific rationalism,
which once threatened to obliterate all the ancient landmarks
of morality and religion alike. He made mistakes,
and he admitted and corrected them, because he verily loved
Truth for her own sake. And to the very end of his long life
he kept the windows of his soul wide open to what he believed
to be the light of this and other worlds.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was, then, a man of lofty ideals, and his idealism
<span class="tei-pb" id="page239">[pg 239]</span>
<a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was at the base of his opposition to the materialism which
boasted that Natural Selection explained all adaptation,
and that Physics could give the solution of Huxley&#39;s poser
to Spencer: "Given the molecular forces in a mutton chop,
deduce Hamlet and Faust therefrom," and which regarded
mind as a quality of matter as brightness is a quality of
steel, and life as the result of the organisation of matter
and not its cause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"We have ourselves," wrote Prof. H.F. Osborn in an
account of Wallace&#39;s scientific work which Wallace praised,
"experienced a loss of confidence with advancing years, an
increasing humility in the face of transformations which
become more and more mysterious the more we study them,
although we may not join with this master in his appeal to
an organising and directing principle." But profound contemplation
of nature and of the mind of man led Wallace
to belief in God, to accept the Divine origin of life and
consciousness, and to proclaim a hierarchy of spiritual
beings presiding over nature and the affairs of nations.
"Whatever," writes Dr. H.O. Forbes, "may be the last
words on the deep and mysterious problems to which Wallace
addressed himself in his later works, the unquestioned
consensus of the highest scientific opinion throughout the
world is that his work has been for more than half a century,
and will continue to be, a living stimulus to interpretation
and investigation, a fertilising and vivifying force in
every sphere of thought."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">It is perhaps unprofitable to go further than in
previous chapters into his so-called heresies‚Äîpolitical,
scientific or religious. Yet we may imitate his boldness
and ask whether he was not, perhaps, in advance of his
age and whether his heresies were not shrewd anticipations
of some truth at present but partially revealed.
Take the example of Spiritualism, which, I suppose,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span>
<a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
has more opponents than anti-vaccination. No one can
overlook the fact that Spiritualism has many scientific
exponents‚ÄîMyers, Crookes, Lodge, Barrett and others.
Prejudices against Spiritualism are as unscientific as the
credulity which swallows the mutterings of every medium.
Podmore&#39;s two ponderous volumes on the History of
Spritualism are marred by an obvious anxiety to make
the very least, if not the very worst, of every phenomenon
alleged to be spiritualistic. That kind of deliberate and
obstinate blindness which prided itself on being the clear
cold light of science Wallace scorned and denounced. He
did not insist upon spiritualistic manifestations shaping
themselves according to his own predesigned moulds in
order to be investigated. He watched for facts whatever
form they assumed. He fully recognised that the phenomena
he saw and heard could be easily ridiculed, but behind them
he as fully believed that he came into contact with spiritual
realities which remain, and which led him to other explanations
of the higher faculties of man and the origin of life
and consciousness than were acceptable to the materialistic
followers of Haeckel, B√ºchner and Huxley. And who dares
dogmatically to assert in the name of science and in the
second decade of the twentieth century, when the deeper
meanings of evolution are being revealed, and the philosophy
of Bergson is spoken about on the housetops, that he was
wrong? In these views may he not become the peer of
Darwin?</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">At first blush it may seem to be a bad example of special
pleading to attempt to discover the reason for his opposition
to vaccination in his idealism. But it is not far from the
truth. He believed in a Ministry of Public Health, that
doctors should be servants of the State, and that they
should be paid according as they kept people well and not
ill. Health is the natural condition of the human body
<span class="tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span>
<a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
when it is properly sustained and used. And chemicals,
even in sickness, are of less importance than fresh air,
light and proper food. He ridiculed, too, the notion of
unhealthy places. "It is like," he wrote to Mr. Birch,
"the old idea that every child must have measles, and
the sooner the better." To the same correspondent, who
was contemplating going into virgin forests and who expressed
his fear of malaria, he replied: "There is no
special danger of malaria or other diseases in a dense
forest region. I am sure this is a delusion, and the dense
virgin forests, even when swampy, are, in a state of nature,
perfectly healthy to live in. It is man&#39;s tampering with
them, and man&#39;s own bad habits of living, that render them
unhealthy. Having now gone over all Spruce&#39;s journals
and letters during his twelve years&#39; life in and about the
Amazonian forests, I am sure this is so. And even where
a place is said to be notoriously &#39;malarious,&#39; it is mostly
due not to infection only but to predisposition due to malnutrition
or some bad mode of living. A person living
healthily may, for the most part, laugh at such terrors.
Neither I nor Spruce ever got fevers when we lived in the
forests and were able to get wholesome food." "Health,"
he said to the present writer, "is the best resistant to disease,
and not the artificial giving of a mild form of a disease in
order to render the body immune to it for a season. Vaccination
is not only condemned upon the statistics which are
used to uphold it, but it is a false principle‚Äîunscientific,
and therefore doomed to fail in the end." Besides which,
he believed in mental healing, and had recorded definite
and certain benefit from spiritual "healers." And he reminded
himself that amongst doctors (witness the blind
opposition encountered by Lister&#39;s discoveries) were found
from time to time not a few enemies of the true healing art,
and obstinate defenders of many forms of quackery.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span>
<a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Wallace made no claim to be an original investigator.
He knew his limitations, and said again and again that
he could not have conducted the slow and minute researches
or have accumulated the vast amount of detailed
evidence to which Darwin, with infinite patience, devoted
his life. He was genuinely glad that it had not fallen to
his lot to write "The Origin of Species." He felt that his
chief faculty was to reason from facts which others discovered.
Yet he had that original insight and creative
faculty which enabled him to see, often as by flashlight,
the explanation which had remained hidden from the eyes
of the man who was most familiar with the particular
facts, and he elaborated it with quickening pulse, anxious
to put down the whole conception which filled his mind
lest some portion of it should escape him. Therein lay
one secret of his great genius. He often said that he was
an idler, but we know that he was a patient and industrious
worker. His idleness was his way of describing his long
musings, waiting the bidding of her whom God inspires‚ÄîTruth,
who often hides her face from the clouded eyes of
man. For hours, days, weeks, he was disinclined to work.
He felt no constraining impulse, his attention was relaxed or
engaged upon a novel, or his seeds, or the plan of a new
house, which always excited his interest. Then, apparently
suddenly, whilst in one of his day-dreams, or in a
fever (as at Ternate, to recall the historical episode when
the theory of Natural Selection struck him), an explanation,
a theory, a discovery,<a name="noteref_69" id="noteref_69"></a><a href="#note_69"><span class="footnoteref">69</span></a> the plan of a new book, came to him
like a flash of light, and with the plan the material, the arguments,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page243">[pg 243]</span>
<a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the illustrations; the words came tumbling one over
the other in his brain, and as suddenly his idleness vanished,
and work, eager, prolonged, unwearying, filled his days and
months and years until the message was written down and
the task fully accomplished. Whilst writing he referred to
few books, but wrote straight on, adding paragraph to paragraph,
chapter to chapter, without recasting or revision.<a name="noteref_70" id="noteref_70"></a><a href="#note_70"><span class="footnoteref">70</span></a>
And the result was fresh, striking, original. It was a
creation. The work being done, he relapsed into his busy
idleness. The truth, as he saw it, seemed to come to him.
Some people called him a prophet, but he was not conscious
of that high calling. I do not remember him saying
that he was only a messenger. Perhaps later, when
he was reviewing his life, he connected his sudden inspirations
with a higher source, but for their realisation he
relied upon a foundation of veritable facts, facts patiently
accumulated, a foundation laid broad and deep. He had
the vision of the prophet allied with the wisdom of the
philosopher and the calm mental detachment of the man
of science. Perhaps another explanation of his genius
may be found in his open-mindedness. Truth found ready
access to his conscience, and always a warm welcome, and
he saw with open eyes where others were stone-blind.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He belonged to our common humanity. No caste or
acquired pride or unapproachable intellectualism cut him off
from the people. His simple humanness made him one with
us all. And his humanity was singularly comprehensive.
It led him, for instance, to investigate the subject of
<span class="tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span>
<a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
suffering in animals. He noticed that all good men and
women rightly shrank from giving pain to them, and he set
himself to prove that the capacity for pain decreased as we
descended the scale of life, and that poets and others were
mistaken when they imputed acute suffering to the lower
creation, because of the very restricted response of their
nervous system. Even in the case of the human infant, he
concluded that only very slight sensations are at first required,
and that such only are therefore developed. The
sensation of pain does not, probably, reach its maximum
till the whole organism is fully developed in the adult individual.
"This," he added, with that characteristic touch
which made him kin to all oppressed people, "is rather
comforting in view of the sufferings of so many infants
needlessly sacrificed through the terrible defects of our
vicious social system."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">To Wallace pain was the birth-cry of a soul&#39;s advance‚Äîthe
stamp of rank in nature is capacity for pain. Pain,
he held, was always strictly subordinated to the law of
utility, and was never developed beyond what was actually
needed for the protection and advance of life. This brings
the sensitive soul immense relief. Our susceptibility to
the higher agonies is a condition of our advance in life&#39;s
pageant.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Take another instance. Amongst his numerous correspondents
there were not a few who decided not to take
life, for food, or science, or in war. One young man who
went out with the assistance of Wallace to Trinidad and
Brazil to become a naturalist, and to whom he wrote
many letters<a name="noteref_71" id="noteref_71"></a><a href="#note_71"><span class="footnoteref">71</span></a> of direction and encouragement, gave up
the work of collecting‚Äîto Wallace&#39;s sincere disappointment‚Äîand
came home because he felt that it was wrong
to take the lives of such wondrous and beautiful birds and
<span class="tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span>
<a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
insects. Another correspondent, who had joined the Navy,
wrote a number of long letters to Wallace setting forth his
conscientious objections to killing, arrived at after reading
Wallace&#39;s books; and although Wallace endeavoured from
prudential considerations to restrain him from giving up
his position, he nevertheless wholly sympathised with him
and in the end warmly defended him when it was necessary
to do so. The sacrifice, too, of human life in dangerous
employments for the purpose of financial gain, no less than
the frightful slaughter of the battlefield, was abhorrent to
Wallace and aroused his intensest indignation. Life to
him was sacred. It had its origin in the spiritual kingdom.
"We are lovers of nature, from &#39;bugs&#39; up to
&#39;humans,&#39;" he wrote to Mr. Fred Birch.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">By every means he laboured earnestly to secure an equal
opportunity of leading a useful and happy life for all men
and women. He championed the cause of women‚Äîof their
freer life and their more active and public part in national
service. He found the selective agency, which was to work
for the amelioration he desired, in a higher form of sexual
selection, which will be the prerogative of women; and therefore
woman&#39;s position in the not distant future "will be
far higher and more important than any which has been
claimed for or by her in the past." When political and
social rights are conceded to her on equality with men, her
free choice in marriage, no longer influenced by economic
and social considerations, will guide the future moral progress
of the race, restore the lost equality of opportunity to
every child born in our country, and secure the balance
between the sexes. "It will be their (women&#39;s) special
duty so to mould public opinion, through home training
and social influence, as to render the women of the future
the regenerators of the entire human race."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">He was acutely anxious that his ideals should be realised
<span class="tei-pb" id="page246">[pg 246]</span>
<a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on earth by the masses of the people. He had a large and
noble vision of their future. And he had his plan for their
immediate redemption‚Äînational ownership of the soil, better
housing, higher wages, certainty of employment, abolition of
preventable diseases, more leisure and wider education, not
merely for the practical work of obtaining a livelihood but to
enable them to enjoy art and literature and song. His opposition
to Eugenics (to adopt the word introduced by Galton,
which Wallace called jargon) sprang from his idealism and
his love of the people, as well as from his scientific knowledge.
On the social side he thought that Eugenics offered
less chance of a much-needed improvement of environment
than the social reforms which he advocated, whilst on the
scientific side he believed that the attempt, with our extremely
limited knowledge, to breed men and women by
artificial selection was worse than folly. He feared that, as
he understood it, Eugenics would perpetuate class distinctions,
and postpone social reform, and afford quasi-scientific
excuses for keeping people "in the positions Nature intended
them to occupy," a scientific reading of the more offensive
saying of those who, having plenty themselves, believe that
it is for the good of the lower classes to be dependent upon
others. "Clear up," he said to the present writer one day,
when we drifted into a warm discussion of the teachings of
Eugenists; "change the environment so that all may have
an adequate opportunity of living a useful and happy life,
and give woman a free choke in marriage; and when that
has been going on for some generations you may be in a
better position to apply whatever has been discovered about
heredity and human breeding, and you may then know which
are the better stocks."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Segregation of the unfit," he remarked to an interviewer
after the Eugenic Conference, at which much was
unhappily said that wholly justified his caustic denunciation,
<span class="tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span>
<a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
"is a mere excuse for establishing a medical tyranny.
And we have enough of this kind of tyranny already ...
the world does not want the eugenist to set it straight....
Eugenics is simply the meddlesome interference of an arrogant
scientific priestcraft."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Thus his radicalism and his so-called fads were born of
his high aspirations. He was not the recluse calmly spinning
theories from a bewildering chaos of observations, and
building up isolated facts into the unity of a great and illuminating
conception in the silence and solitude of his library,
unmindful of the great world of sin and sorrow without. He
could say with Darwin, "I was born a naturalist"; but we
can add that his heart was on fire with love for the toiling
masses. He had felt the intense joy of discovering
a vast and splendid generalisation, which not only worked
a complete revolution in biological science, but has also
illuminated the whole field of human knowledge. Yet his
greatest ambition was to improve the cruel conditions under
which thousands of his fellow-creatures suffered and died,
and to make their lives sweeter and happier. His mind
was great enough and his heart large enough to encompass
all that lies between the visible horizons of human
thought and activity, and even in his old age he lived
upon the topmost peaks, eagerly looking for the horizon
beyond. In the words of the late Mr. Gladstone, he
"was inspired with the belief that life was a great and
noble calling; not a mean and grovelling thing that we
are to shuffle through as we can, but an elevated and lofty
destiny."</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">

<p class="tei tei-p">But we must not be tempted into further disquisition.
As he grew older the public Press as well as his friends
celebrated his birthdays. Congratulations by telegram and
letter poured in upon him and gave him great pleasure.

</div>

<p style="text-align: right" class="tei tei-p">W. BRAUNSTON JONES.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Sir William Barrett, one of Wallace&#39;s oldest friends,
visited him during the last year of his life, and thus
describes the visit:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">In the early summer of 1913, some six months before
his death, I had the pleasure of paying another visit and
spending a delightful afternoon with my old friend. His
<span class="tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span>
<a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
health was failing, and he sat wrapped up before a fire in
his study, though it was a warm day. He could not walk
round his garden with me as before, but pointed to the
little plot of ground in front of the French windows of his
study‚Äîwhere he had moved some of his rarer primulas and
other plants he was engaged in hybridising‚Äîand which he
could just manage to visit. His eyesight and hearing
seemed as good as ever, and his intellectual power was
undimmed....</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Dr. Wallace then, pointing to the beautiful expanse
of garden, woodland and sea which was visible from the
large study windows, burst forth with vigorous gesticulation
and flashing eyes: "Just think! All this wonderful
beauty and diversity of nature results from the operation
of a few simple laws. In my early unregenerate days I
used to think that only material forces and natural laws
were operative throughout the world. But these I now
see are hopelessly inadequate to explain this mystery and
wonder and variety of life. I am, as you know, absolutely
convinced that behind and beyond all elementary processes
there is a guiding and directive force; a Divine power or
hierarchy of powers, ever controlling these processes so
that they are tending to more abundant and to higher
types of life."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">This led Dr. Wallace to refer to my published lecture
on "Creative Thought" and express his hearty concurrence
with the line of argument therein; in fact he had
already sent me his views, which, with his consent, I published
as a postscript to that lecture.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Then our conversation turned upon recent political
events, and it was remarkable how closely he had followed,
and how heartily he approved, the legislation of
the Liberal Government of the day. His admiration for Mr.
Lloyd George was unfeigned. "To think that I should
have lived to see so earnest and democratic a Chancellor of
the Exchequer!" he exclaimed, and he confidently awaited
still larger measures which would raise the condition of the
workers to a higher level; and nothing was more striking
than his intense sympathy with every movement for the
<span class="tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span>
<a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
relief of poverty and the betterment of the wage-earning
classes. The land question, we agreed, lay at the root of
the matter, and land nationalisation the true solution. In
fact, ever since I read the proof-sheets of his book on this
subject, which he corrected when staying at my house in
Kingstown, I have been a member of the Land Nationalisation
Society, of which he was President.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Needless to say, Dr. Wallace was an ardent Home Ruler
and Free Trader,<a name="noteref_72" id="noteref_72"></a><a href="#note_72"><span class="footnoteref">72</span></a> but on the latter question he said there
should be an export duty on coal, especially the South
Wales steam coal, as our supply was limited and it
was essential for the prosperity of the country‚Äîand "the
purchaser pays the duty," he remarked. I heartily agreed
with him, and said that a small export duty <span style="font-style: italic" class="tei tei-hi">had</span> been
placed on coal by the Conservative Government, but subsequently
was removed. This he had forgotten, and when
later on I sent him particulars of the duty and its yield,
he replied saying that at that time he was so busy with
the preparation of a book that he had overlooked the
fact. He wrote most energetically on the importance of
the Government being wise in time, and urged at least a
2s. export duty on coal.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">We talked about the question of a portrait of Dr. Wallace
being painted and presented to the Royal Society, which
had been suggested by the Rev. James Marchant, to whom
Dr. Wallace referred, when talking to me, in grateful and
glowing terms.‚ÄîW.F.B.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">Perhaps it should be added to Sir William Barrett&#39;s reminiscences
that the movement which was set on foot to
carry out this project was stayed by Wallace&#39;s death.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">During the last years of his life his pen was seldom
dry. His interest in science and in politics was fresh and
keen to the closing week. He wrote "Social Environment
and Moral Progress" in 1912, at the age of 90. The book
had a remarkable reception. Leading articles and illustrated
reviews appeared in most of the daily newspapers.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span>
<a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
The book, into which he had put his deepest thoughts and
feelings upon the condition of society, was hailed as a
virile and notable production from a truly great man.
After this was issued, he saw another, "The Revolt of
Democracy," through the press. But this did not exhaust
his activities. He entered almost immediately into a contract
to write a big volume upon the social order, and as
a side issue to help, as is mentioned in the Introduction,
in the production of an even larger book upon the writings
and position of Darwin and Wallace and the theory of
Natural Selection as an adequate explanation of organic
evolution. Age did not seem to weaken his amazing fertility
of creative thought, nor to render him less susceptible to
the claims of humanity, which he faced with a noble courage.
In nobility of character and in magnitude, variety and richness
of mind he was amongst the foremost scientific men of
the Victorian Age, and with his death that great period,
which was marked by wide and illuminating generalisations
and the grand style in science, came to an end.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">Apart altogether, however, from his scientific position
and attainments, which set him on high, he was a noble
example of brave, resolute, and hopeful endeavour, maintained
without faltering to the end of a long life. And
this is not the least valuable part of his legacy to the race.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">When Henslow died, Huxley wrote to Hooker: "He had
intellect to comprehend his highest duty distinctly, and force
of character to do it; which of us dare ask for a higher summary
of his life than that? For such a man there can be
no fear in facing the great unknown; his life has been one
long experience of the substantial justice of the laws by
which this world is governed, and he will calmly trust to
them still as he lays his head down for his long sleep." Let
that also stand as the estimate of Wallace by his contemporaries,
an estimate which we believe posterity will confirm.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span>
<a name="Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
And to it we may add that death, which came to him in his
sleep as a gentle deliverer, opened the door into the larger
and fuller life into which he tried to penetrate and in which
he firmly believed. If that faith be founded in truth, Darwin
and Wallace, yonder as here, are united evermore.</p>
</div>

<div class="tei tei-div">
<p class="tei tei-p">I am writing these concluding words on the second
anniversary of his death. Before me there lies the telegram
which brought me the sad news that he had "passed
away very peacefully at 9.25 a.m., without regaining consciousness."
He was in his ninety-first year. It was
suggested that he should be buried in Westminster
Abbey, beside Charles Darwin, but Mrs. Wallace and the
family, expressing his own wishes as well as theirs, did
not desire it. On Monday, November 10th, he was laid
to rest with touching simplicity in the little cemetery of
Broadstone, on a pine-clad hill swept by ocean breezes.
He was followed on his last earthly journey by his son
and daughter, by Miss Mitten, his sister-in-law, and by
the present writer. Mrs. Wallace, being an invalid, was
unable to attend. The funeral service was conducted by
the Bishop of Salisbury (Dr. Ridgeway), and among the
official representatives were Prof. Raphael Meldola and
Prof. E.B. Poulton representing the Royal Society; the
latter and Dr. Scott representing the Linnean Society, and
Mr. Joseph Hyder the Land Nationalisation Society. A
singularly appropriate monument, consisting of a fossil
tree-trunk from the Portland beds, has been erected over
his grave upon a base of Purbeck stone, which bears the
following inscription:</p>

<p style="text-align: center" class="tei tei-p">ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE, O.M.<br />
Born Jan. 8th, 1823, Died Nov. 7th, 1913</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">A year later, on the 10th of December, 1914, his widow
died after a long illness, and was buried in the same grave.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span>
<a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
She was the eldest daughter of Mr. William Mitten, of Hurstpierpoint,
an enthusiastic botanist, and in no mean degree
she inherited her father&#39;s love of wild flowers and of the
beautiful in nature. It was this similarity of tastes which
led to her close intimacy and subsequent marriage, in 1866,
with Wallace. Their married life was an exceedingly happy
one. She was able to help him in his scientific labours,
and she provided that atmosphere in the home life which
enabled him to devote himself to his many-sided enterprises.

<p class="tei tei-p">Soon after Wallace&#39;s death a Committee was formed
(with Prof. Poulton as Chairman and Prof. Meldola as
Treasurer) to erect a memorial, and the following petition
was sent to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em" class="tei tei-quote">
<p class="tei tei-p">We, the undersigned, earnestly desiring a suitable
national memorial to the late Alfred Russel Wallace, and
believing that no position would be so appropriate as
Westminster Abbey, the burial-place of his illustrious
fellow-worker Charles Darwin, petition the Right Reverend
the Dean and Chapter for permission to place a medallion
in Westminster Abbey. We further guarantee, if the medallion
be accepted, to pay the Abbey fees of ¬£200.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="tei tei-p">Mr. Bruce-Joy, who had made an excellent medallion
of Dr. Wallace during his lifetime, accepted the commission
to fashion the medallion for Westminster Abbey, and
it was unveiled, by a happy but undesigned coincidence,
on All Souls&#39; Day, November 1 1915, together with medallions
to the memory of Sir Joseph Hooker and Lord Lister.
In the course of his sermon, the Dean said‚Äîand with these
words we may well conclude this book:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"To-day there are uncovered to the public view, in the
North Aisle of the Choir, three memorials to men who, I
believe, will always be ranked among the most eminent
scientists of the last century. They passed away, one in
1911, one in 1912, and one in 1913. They were all men of
singularly modest character. As is so often observable
in true greatness, there was in them an entire absence of
that vanity and self-advertisement which are not infrequent
with smaller minds. It is the little men who push themselves
into prominence through dread of being overlooked.
<span class="tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span>
<a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It is the great men who work for the work&#39;s sake without
regard to recognition, and who, as we might say, achieve
greatness in spite of themselves.</p>

OF THE CHOIR OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"Alfred Russel Wallace was a most famous naturalist
and zoologist. He arrived by a flash of genius at the same
conclusions which Darwin had reached after sixteen years
of most minute toil and careful observation.... It was a
unique example of the almost exact concurrence of two
great minds working upon the same subject, though in
different parts of the world, without collusion and without
rivalry.... Between Darwin and Wallace goodwill
and friendship were never interrupted. Wallace&#39;s life was
spent in the pursuit of various objects of intellectual and
philosophical interest, over which I need not here linger.
All will agree that it is fitting his medallion should be
placed next to that of Darwin, with whose great name his
own will ever be linked in the worlds of thought and
science.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p">"All will acknowledge the propriety of these three great
names being honoured in this Abbey Church, even though
it be, to use Wordsworth&#39;s phrase, already</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
